            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THeſe Sermons were preached, when God's Judgments were deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Nations, by Sword and Peſtilence, to ſecond the <hi>works</hi> of God with the <hi>word</hi> of God, for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving edification of the puniſhed. Now becauſe we are apt to forget the Rods of
<pb facs="tcp:66474:3"/>God, and his words, and our duty urged by them both, I have thought it might be profitable (at leaſt) to ſome, to publiſh theſe Diſcourſes, ſuch as they be, and leave them to the bleſſing of God, and the good and candid acceptation of ſuch, as ſhall pleaſe to peruſe them The Sword and Peſtilence were not ſtrokes of God, which only concern'd the City of <hi>London,</hi> but the whole three Nations, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe Inſtructions are due and proper to all the People of God, and to any that have a heart to make uſe of them. Our Fathers went under five Miracles, ſaith One, through the Wilderneſs, the Cloud, the raining of daily Manna, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Waters from the Rock <hi>Horeb,</hi> the continual newneſs of their Cloaths, and the untiredneſs of their Feet. The People of God in theſe Nations, have gone under many wonderful Providences, to that ſtate of tranquility wherein now they are, this among them all is a ſtanding one, that the Buſh hath ſo long burned, and yet is not quite conſumed, neither by Plague nor Sword, nor any other hard things done unto them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:66474:3"/>
            <p>How the late Judgments were uſhered in amongſt us, with ſigns in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, in the Earth, and in the Seas, we cannot quite forget: Several blaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stars in one Year's ſpace, the like ſcarce not known, and other multiplyed Prodigies many ways; and how they are all gone off, with heightned ſecurity, and multiplied prodigious wickedneſs, may juſtly affect us much to conſider, and affright us more to think, what worſe things may quickly come upon us. Our lives during the late Judgments did hang in doubt from God and man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God would ſpare us from the Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or Man ſpare us from the Sword. The dread of the Sword was not ſmall, when the Seas did roar, and the Rivers alſo at our Doors. <hi>The dread of the Plague was many Plagues;</hi> I am ſure the beſt Christians that felt it, will ſay, that ſpiritual stroke not to have been ſmall, though their lives ſince (I fear) may more than ſay it to be ſo. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Angel paſsed over few Houſes, and ſome he ſwept clean, and no <hi>Lord have mercy on us,</hi> heard for ſo much
<pb facs="tcp:66474:4"/>as one. Other Houſes had ſome ſpared, but with <hi>Hezekia</hi>'s mark, a Plague ſoar on their Bodies, and a worſe upon their hearts, both which continue to this day. Under all this dreadful Diſcipline, what was done then and ſince, to ſhew repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, reformation, thankfulneſs for ſuch great eſcapes, may well cauſe great and deep thoughts of heart. From <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> were Twenty-Six Generations, and accordingly doth the Pſalmist praiſe God ſix and twenty times, according to the numeral letters of the word <hi>Jehova,</hi> who did all the wonders for that People, which are mentioned in that <hi>136 Pſalm.</hi> And ſurely ſix and twenty times over, hath the Lord merited praiſes, and all worthy walking, at all our hands, high and low, for the many great things he hath done for us at Sea and Land, but I pray God we be not found ſix and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty times worſe than then we were.</p>
            <p>Some remindings of God's great works amongst us, by his word (I think all will grant) are therefore needful, and pitty it is but the word of God, ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:66474:4"/>go freely forth over the Nations for ſuch great ends, to preach over the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God afreſh unto us; If the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of God must repeat and preach themſelves again, for want of the word, that will not be ſo pleaſing, nor it may be, not ſo profitable for us. Many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands were killed by the Sword and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, but few (I fear) made ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually alive by either. The word, O the powerful preaching of the word of God; <hi>This, this</hi> kindly convinceth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth, yea and diverteth Sword and Peſtilence, and Famine, with all other judgments, as all experience and divine Hiſtory ſheweth. What proſperous times for health and wealth, peace and plenty, were in <hi>Juda,</hi> when they were zealous to promote the word and true worſhip of God! when we fall out with theſe, God, he falls on upon us with one judgment or other; If men do not believe this, they may feel it ſeven times more. Our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is enmity to all good, ſome thing is treated of this and its cure, in this tract, which indeed is the cure of all evils; for whence come Wars and contentions?
<pb facs="tcp:66474:5"/>Come they not from our unmortified lusts, which war in our corrupt hearts? Death, whether by Sword, or Peſtilence, or any how, is no good friend to an ill life: ſome thing alſo is ſaid of this, in this Tract, to make us remember our later end, to live and die well. In mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of all ſorts we need friends, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from Men, as well as mercy from God; ſome thing therefore is ſaid in this Tract, to quicken to this, to be pitiful and tender hearted one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Clouds return after rain, and make more and greater ſtorms; ſome thing is ſaid of this too, and much more may be felt, if we do not repent. <hi>Kadeſh Barnea</hi> was ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from a double puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.<note place="margin">GOD may ſanctify Himſelf upon Us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is not ſanctified in Us. And he may make us wandering Sons, becauſe we ſtill wander much from Him.</note> It was called <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſh,</hi> becauſe there the Lord ſanctified himſelf upon the People, for their corporal and ſpiritual Whoredomes with the <hi>Midianites:</hi> And it was called <hi>barnea,</hi> or the wandering Son, becauſe there was the Decree made,
<pb facs="tcp:66474:5"/>for their long wandering in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. Pray God we be not called <hi>Kadeſh Barnea</hi> too, for our making ſo little good uſe of former puniſhments. God's double puniſhments and troops of calamities, even all his waves may paſs over us juſtly: ſome thing of this alſo is ſaid, in the last part of this Tract; the Lord bleſs all to all that peruſe theſe things.</p>
            <p>The People of God loving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fervently, profiting one another with their Gifts, Graces, Eſtates; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſober, ſound in the faith, holy, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly; and about this glory a defence will make States and Nations bleſsed. Surely if we (the Lord's People) were but as zealous to uſe liberty and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge well, as we are to have it, it would come faſter than it doth. Let us look more into our ſelves, and more up to God, as the readieſt way to all good: Theſe are the thoughts, deſires, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Him, who is</p>

               <p>Now, to deliver us from the Body of this death, a Body of corruption, which expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us to ſuch a death as this: There no Man, nor Angel is able, no all the Angels, did they joyn to do us ſervice in this thing, to change our natures, to take off guilt, to rectifie the Image of God, which we have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66474:7"/>loſt; they cannot ſtir this Body, as to any of theſe in the leaſt, nor any member of it; they are not able to remove one ſin, or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for the guilt of it; nor draw one line, an eye, or an eye-brow, or one finger of the new man. This great weight of ſin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and this utter impotency of all created ſtrength to help out of it, maketh the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to cry out thus: <hi>O wretched man that I am: Who ſhall deliver me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> There be ſeveral things very profitable to be obſerved in theſe words; as, <hi>Firſt,</hi> this, <hi>That every one is in a wretched and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition by nature;</hi> Depraved in all powers of Soul and Body, and expoſed in both to the utmoſt diſpleaſure of God. <hi>O wretched man that I am,</hi> &amp;c. He doth not mean himſelf alone, but ſpeaketh as perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating the beſt of men, and ſo conſequently all men; for that he did thus complain of a corrupt ſtate, who was ſo holy; who elſe, but hath cauſe much more to complain? For this death which my Text, ſpeaketh of, hath paſſed over all Men, for as much as all Men have finned in <hi>Adam.</hi> And this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle which ſpeaketh but of himſelf in this caſe in my Text ſpeaketh generally elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; <hi>That by nature we are the Children of wrath, as well as others,</hi> Eph. 2.3.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This may be learned from theſe words, <hi>That our state by nature, is not a ſafe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66474:8"/>ſtate to be reſted in.</hi> That our ſtate, as we come into this World, is not ſuch, as we ſhould be contented with, but a ſtate much to be complain'd of by the beſt, and much cryed out upon, and much ſtrugled under to be freed from. <hi>O wretched man that I am: Who ſhall deliver me?</hi> &amp;c. Fleſh and blood cannot enter into the Kingdome of God. They which reſt in their ſtate, as they come into this World, and think that they attain to be moral and civil, juſt and righteous to men, and little or nothing complain of that which the Apoſtle doth here in my Text, <hi>a Body of Death,</hi> do not know their own danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We may here learn, <hi>That the beſt are not ſo good as they ſhould be:</hi> That the beſt in this World, are much burdened and much endangered, with natural corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> though regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, found much of the rebellion of an evil nature, of which he knew not how to get rid, carrying him Captive to what he would not, and ſo expoſing him continually to the diſpleaſure of God. <hi>I know that in me, that is, in my Fleſh dwelleth no good thing, for to will is preſent with me, but how to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that which is good, I finde not; for the good I would I do not, but the evil I would not that I do.</hi> Corrupt nature, as it eaſily beſets us, ſo it as eaſily overcomes us, for any ſtrength that we have of our own: Such
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66474:8"/>as ſo feelingly complain, as <hi>Paul</hi> here doth, will not eaſily be brought to drink in the Popiſh Doctrin of Perfection.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We may here learn, <hi>That our ſtate in this World, at beſt, is but a wretched state;</hi> for, though a little grace be given unto us, it is ſo over-matched with a great body of ſin, that we rather undo, than do any thing that is good. Is it not a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtate to be ſo hampered with an ill In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Night and Day, that when one pulls one way, 'tother pulls ſtronger ſtill the wrong way. To ſee two Dogs coupled, a little one and a great one, What a woful condition is the little one in! how he is pulled and haled up and down this way and that way, not which way he would go, but which way the great one will go, or elſe he grins his teeth on the little one, and bites him and abuſeth him much; juſt ſo is the condition of the moſt regenerate in this World. And therefore he that is beſt, and hath beſt in this World, can ſay no better of it than he findes, and daily feels, that his condition is but a wretched condition; <hi>O wretched man that I am,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Point which I would ſtand on,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                  </label> is this, <hi>That we all ought to be deeply ſenſible of natural corruption:</hi> Or, we all ought much to lay to heart our fallen ſtate by nature. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was a holy Man, yet
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66474:9"/>very ſenſible of much unholineſs, a body of it, of which he was little other than the Soul, and this he groans and ſighs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; <hi>O wretched man that I am,</hi> &amp;c. And, this written for our Example: Take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtance in this Apoſtle, as ſoon as converted. <hi>And Saul aroſe from the Earth, and when his Eyes were opened he ſaw no man, but they led him by the Hand; and he was three Days without ſight, and did neither eat nor drink,</hi> Act. 9.9. Why did he neither eat nor drink for three Days? Doubtleſs he was in a deep ſenſe of his loſt condition, as one in the gall of bitterneſs, and bonds of iniquity, both by nature and practice: That his natural corruption was ſo great a weight upon him afterward, as we here ſee it was by my Text, it was much more heavy upon him at firſt view, when this bottomly gulf was firſt opened to this ſelf-conceited Phariſee, what I ſay is very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the three Days horror and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein he lay ſtarving himſelf; Doubtleſs he thought himſelf as unworthy to eat or drink, ſo unworthy to live, as the poor Publican which ſmote his breaſt, and would not look up to Heaven, as not judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf worthy to go upon the Earth. The eating of the Paſſ-over with ſower Herbs might point at this, for their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſnadowed their coming out of ſpiritual bondage and miſery, in which they were: And ſo the miſeries of natural
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66474:9"/>bondage by ſin, and our fall: and then their ſower Herbs, might well teach them, as to keep a ſenſe of their bodily ſlavery and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; ſo eſpecially to keep a deep ſenſe of their ſoul-ſlavery and miſery, and all the ſower things and conflicts of their inward condition. The poor Jaylor may be a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther authority, for this Doctrine which I have obſerved: His eyes being ſome thing opened, to ſee what a wretched Man he was by his nature and practice, trembled, and would have made away himſelf, and came and fell at the Apoſtles Feet, with a great out-cry, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> Act. 16.30.</p>
               <p>And whereas I make the Propoſition U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal, ſaying, <hi>That we all ought to be deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of natural corruption.</hi> I ground it upon my Text, and the Example that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to follow, in ſuch an eminent Man as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was: That the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was not exempted from natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, nor from this duty of deep-laying it to heart, neither are others. But then the Queſtion will be, by what Rule the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did this, for he himſelf ſaith, that we ſhould follow him no otherwiſe, than as he followed <hi>Chriſt;</hi> By what Rule then did the Apoſtle thus lay to heart his fallen ſtate? And was his Rule univerſal, that is, for all the fallen Sons of <hi>Adam?</hi> For this, ſee, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.38. When the Houſe, for communion between God and Man, was
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66474:10"/>made and conſecrated, this is the great Law of fellowſhip and communion between God and Man, <hi>That even every one ſhould know the Plague of his heart.</hi> Now, by the Plague of the heart, is meant, ſaith Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, principally our fallen and corrupt ſtate of Soul by nature, and then ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſpecial ebullitions thereof in act, to open ſcandal and provocation; And this one Law is for <hi>Jew</hi> and ſtranger: And by knowing this Plague of the heart, which every one was to do, means that they ſhould be well acquainted with their natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and actual tranſgreſſions, and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bewail them, and truly, as having to do with an All-ſeeing and All-ſearching God, who ſearcheth the heart: ſo it follows, in the next words, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 39. What Prayer or Supplication ſoever be made by any Man, or by all the People of <hi>Iſrael, which ſhall know every Man the Plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands towards this houſe, then hear thou in Heaven thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do, and give to every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ways, whoſe heart thou knoweſt, for thou, even thou knoweſt all the hearts of the Children of Men.</hi> The New Teſtament concurreth to this, in as much as <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt thus began the Goſpel, by calling upon all to repent, and ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf called upon all his hearers to repent, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.17. The other of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.2. <hi>From that time Jeſus began to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66474:10"/>preach, and to ſay, Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> This is the Power of God by the Word, to change your hearts, and to open the everlaſting Doors: By re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, he means, what he ſaith further in his Sermon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3, 4, 5. Poor in ſpirit, mourning for ſin, attended with a deſire of relief, a hungering and thirſting for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtate. That is, Repentance is, that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners be throughly convinced of their loſt condition by nature, and of their utter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to make their own relief and eſcape, from the diſpleaſure of God due unto them by it, and therefore hunger and thirſt, that is, earneſtly deſire relief from God, in that way which he hath appointed in <hi>Chriſt</hi> through the Goſpel, for the Salvation of ſinners. Thus, and in this Path the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can was taught to come, begging mercy for a ſinner. He ſmote his breaſt, as that where he felt the Plague lay, and ſaid, <hi>God be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to me a ſinner.</hi> I purpoſe to ſay no more, to prove the truth of the Point.</p>
               <p>For the Explication of this Doctrin, theſe things may be ſaid, wherein the further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Point will ariſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> We ſhould be deeply ſenſible of natural corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in its being ſimply conſidered. <hi>Behold, I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my Mother conceive me,</hi> Pſal. 51.5. <hi>David</hi> had fallen into great actual tranſgreſſions, of Murther and Whoredom, and he, that he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66474:11"/>might practice repentance, according to the rule thereof, took to heart how he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World; Behold, I am an old ſinner ſo born, ſhaped in iniquity in the Womb, and out of this ſhape I cannot change my ſelf, and therefore I complain to thee, O God, Do thou waſh me throughly, and cleanſe me throughly, that is, juſtifie and ſanctifie me with the Blood and Spirit of thine anointed one, on whom thou haſt laid my help: So in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. <hi>What is ſorry man, Enoſh,</hi> or wretched man, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Epithet is in my Text, that thou art mindful of ſuch a forlorne Creature, which words alſo ſhew, that we ſhould be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of our natural ſtate in the Being, yea, in the firſt being of it in us. Our Saviour in his Sermon to the Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> confirmeth this that I am upon, that we ſhould all, <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> be ſenſible of corrupt nature in the being of it. <hi>But he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, I am not ſent but to the loſt ſheep of the Houſe of Iſrael;</hi> by theſe words he names the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtate by nature, to make this Gentile reflect upon her own ſtate, as alſo ſuch, and loſt. <hi>Then came ſhe and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped, ſaying, Lord help me.</hi> As if ſhe had ſaid with much ſorrow of heart, if there be any loſt Creature in the World, ſurely I am one. Then Chriſt replies again. <hi>It is not meet to take the Childrens bread, and to give it to Dogs.</hi> By which words Chriſt would inſinuate more particularly to her,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66474:11"/>what the ſtate of us Gentiles is by nature, as Dogs moſt fierce againſt Sheep, oppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> to all good, and inclined (as Dogs) to all ill, and miſchievous qualities and ways. By which words it is evident, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> would have this Woman well acquainted with the being of her natural condition, that there is ſuch a great miſchief befallen us, that we are by nature rather Dogs, and Bears, and Wolves, and Tygars than Men, than holy Men as we were created; and that this poor Woman did make this uſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Doctrin, appears by her reply, <hi>And ſhe ſaid, truth Lord, yet the Dogs eat off the Crumbs which fall from their Maſters Table,</hi> Mat. 15.24, 25, 26, 27. Truth Lord, I am more like a Dog, or any Brute, than what I ſhould be, and by my ſin become as the Beaſt which periſheth. 1. Ignorant, darkned in my co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, profane, alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance, that is in me. Add to this, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. Where we find great blame is caſt upon the Church of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odicea,</hi> that ſhe ſaid, <hi>She was rich and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in goods, and needed nothing, and knew not that ſhe was poor, and blind, and wretched,</hi> (which is the word of my Text.) <hi>and naked.</hi> Did not know this and that: 1. Did not deeply lay to heart, that by nature they were corrupt, and in a wretched condition, and deſtitute of what-ever ſhould make them truly bleſſed, truly rich, and truly wiſe, and truly happy; they were vainly puffed up, it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66474:12"/>ſeems, with ſome few gifts and parts, and not aware of the pravity of all, and of the whole that Man is by nature, and therefore proud, as otherwiſe could not chooſe but be, as a Peacock of his Feathers, whil'ſt he looketh only on his Tail, and not on his Legs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We ſhould be deeply ſenſible of natural corruption, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in the vaſtneſs of its Beeing, as it is a <hi>whole Body,</hi> a great, and large corporation of all wickedneſs, defiling and deſtroying all; ſo was <hi>Paul, Who ſhall deliver me from this Body,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If thine eye be evil, the whole Body ſhall be filled with darkneſs.</hi> That is, ſaith the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, If thy affections be corrupt, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to this World; If a ſinners affections be naught, Set upon this World, and any of the luſts of it, he is under the weight and ſlavery of the whole body of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.23. And this doth Chriſt preach, to make ſinners ſenſible of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive beeing of natural corruption, that it is a little leaven which hath <hi>leavened the whole lump.</hi> The Apoſtle was ſenſible of natural corruption, as in the beeing of it, ſo in the extenſiveneſs of its beeing, he was ſenſible of concupiſcence, that Fire which is in the nature to evil, and he was ſenſible of the extenſiveneſs of this evil, —<hi>All manner of concupiſcence,</hi> Rom. 7.7, 8. I had not known luſt, ſaith the margent, concupiſcence, that is, I had not been prickt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66474:12"/>at heart for it, and deeply ſenſible of it, but that the convincing power of the Lord helped on this work. But ſin taking occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the commandment ſtirred and irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated this luſt, and ſet all on fire, wrought <hi>in me all manner of concupiſcence,</hi> that is, wicked luſts and heart-burnings. Angels appeared in white, to ſhew the purity of their nature, ſay the <hi>Dutch,</hi> on <hi>Act.</hi> 1.10. And we ſhould be always in black, in mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to ſhew the impurity of our nature in the vaſtneſs of it; for, from the crown of the Head to the ſole of the Foot, we are nothing but bruiſes and putrifying ſores, which are not dreſſed at all, nor bound up, but all open and running, and ſtinking in every ones Noſthrils, of which in bodily matters we are deeply ſenſible. All theſe metaphors are made into an allegory, on purpoſe to make fallen man ſenſible of the extenſiveneſs of his miſery by his Fall, that he is bruiſed all over, in his Head, in his Breaſt, in his Legs, from top to bottom, no part ſound and incorrupt. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaketh of being born in ſin, and of <hi>being altogether born in ſin,</hi> the one ſpeaketh the being of our fallen ſtate, of which we ſhould be ſenſible, and the other ſpeaketh of the vaſtneſs and extenſiveneſs of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of which alſo we ſhould be ſenſible; <hi>Thou art altogether born in ſin,</hi> Joh. 9.34. They ſpake truth, though they did it not to a good end: Yet the words in themſelves
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66474:13"/>are true, and have a good ſcope, that we might be made ſenſible of our fallen ſtate, and how great it is, how great our fall is, how it hath bruiſed and putrified, and ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We ſhould be deeply ſenſible of natural corruption, in all the properties of it: As, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The averſneſs of it to all good: If natural corruption were a meer impotency to all good, it were not ſo evil. But it is an averſation; that a body can never go to meal with a ſtomack, how ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible is any one of this, as a great miſery? This is our caſe ſpiritual, we can never go to pray, to hear, to meditate, to any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duty, but our hearts hang off, and hang this way and that way, that we go<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as if we were going to Hell: Should we not be deeply ſenſible of this? that we are ſtill a ſilly Dove without heart, to all that is heavenly. The poor Marriners were very ſenſible, that they found one in their Ship which untrimmed it, <hi>Jon.</hi> 1. This Man, though a good man, yet when the Ship and he toſſed, and like all to be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he was ſo drowſie that he could not hold open his eyes, like the Diſciples of Chriſt, when their Maſter was ready to be leized on, yet were drowſie and could not watch and pray; Should not ſuch an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedneſs to good, if the body of death had no other bad property, deeply be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed?
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66474:13"/>I have heard ſome complain, and indeed it ſhould be for a lamentation, that ſometimes even in this duty of hearing, have not been able to hold open their eyes, and yet at all common buſineſs as well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake as can be. The Church was called upon to this and that Divine duty, and ſhe had put off her Coat, and knew not how to put it on; natural corruption hath this ill property, never ready, nor dreſſed, and fitted to any good, and yet at the ſame time ready and dreſſed to any thing that is evil, as wiſe to this, as fooliſh to any thing that is good: The natural man, or animal man, is a Soul too low ſtill for any matter divine; which thing alone, if there were no other evil property in natural corruption, ſhould be deeply laid to heart.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Second</hi> property of natural corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is perverſneſs. <hi>Vain Man would be wiſe, though he be born as the wilde Aſs-colt,</hi> Job. 11.12. This <hi>Zophar</hi> ſpake of <hi>Job,</hi> as ſeeing him perverſe, as he thought; but he was right enough as to the thing, though not as to <hi>Job</hi> in this matter. Thus we are by nature, of no more reaſon than a wilde Aſs, and yet as unturnable as that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The old Man is proud, and wilful, yea preſumptuous, yea of enmity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight if reſiſted, as Lions and Dragons are, ſpitting their ſome and poiſon as Cats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the face of all that contradict.

And all this continually, as the Blackamore that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not change his skin.

Alas, he made nothing of hunger, of nakedneſs, of ſtripes, of deaths oft, but gloried in them.

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis needful work this, to know every Man the Plague of his own heart. To know it, that is to ſigh and groan under it, as here the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth. When <hi>Daniel</hi> had received that ſad Viſion of <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi>'s ruin, the lopping down of that tall Tree which reached to Heaven, and the ſad condition of a beaſt which he was to be caſt into. <hi>Daniel</hi> remained ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him, and he was not able to ſay a word to the King, but ſighed and lookt ſad, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.19.

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This is to go to the Root of our Diſeaſe, to lay an Axe to the Root. The
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66474:20"/>Apoſtle was wiſe, when he fell upon the main body of wickedneſs in him. <hi>Son of man cauſe Jeruſalem to know her abominations, and ſay, Thus ſaith the Lord God unto all Jeruſalem, thy Birth and thy Nativity is of the Land of Canaan, thy Father was an Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and thy Mother an Hittite, and thy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel was not cut, nor ſalted,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.2, 3. You cannot know your abominations, as you ſhould, that is, be affected with them, as you ſhould, unleſs you look to the Root, from whence they all ſpring, and fix your eyes and your hearts there well, according to this wholeſome inſtruction of the Lord. We are by nature <hi>Amorites</hi> and <hi>Hittites,</hi> as wilde as any, Children of wrath as well as others, and in us: <hi>(i.e.)</hi> In our nature dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth no good, but the ſeeds of all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and until we thus go to the bottom, we do in our humiliations but skin over ſoares, and not ſearch and cleanſe them well. This, this Apoſtle calleth for, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Purge out therefore the old leaven;</hi> what a deal a-do there was to ſearch out leaven, and to get totally rid of it; among the <hi>Jews</hi> much is ſaid of it: the Apoſtle would have us as induſtrious about corrupt nature, which he calleth old leaven, in all our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations, wherein there ſhould be ſoul-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations, that we ſhould fall cloſe upon our evil hearts and ſtate within, and ſmite upon them, and cry out much upon them. <hi>Damni dans cauſam, damnum ipſum dediſſe

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There is no dealing with any actual ſin, without effectual dealing with the body of ſin. To go to lave a Pool, and not firſt to deal with the Spring, as it is fooliſh, ſo it is an endleſs work. How can a clean thing come out of an unclean? If the heart remain ſtill filthy, How is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to make the life holy? Hence it is, that the heart is ſo much called for to be cleanſed, and that ſinck to be well lookt after, becauſe there is the ſeat of natural pravity, and the very Core of all corruption. Cut off branches, as you would lop a Tree, cut them off all, and leave the roots <hi>through the ſent of mud they will grow,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith; every occaſion and temptation, ſo long as the nature remains unrenewed and unlookt to, will make ſin break out afreſh, and the Dog will return to his own vomit.

                  </gap>ion, is, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> as the Apoſtle here calls him. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek, he hath ſent me to bind up the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hearted to proclaim liberty unto the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and the opening of the Priſon to them that are bound,</hi> Iſa. 61.1. By Captives, and ſuch as are in Priſon, is meant ſinners in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66474:26"/>their unregenerated condition, who are under the power and ſlavery of ſin, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Captive by the evil one at his will; and by broken hearted and poor, he means ſuch as are deeply affected and afflicted with the body of death, natural corruption, in the guilt and pollution of it; theſe is <hi>Chriſt</hi> anointed with the Spirit of the Lord, to relieve and help, to bind them up, and all their wounds and putrified ſoares, and to heal them; and to preach liberty to them, and to bring them into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God; and ſuch as are ſhut up under the power of ſin and Satan, as in a Priſon, to break down theſe ſtrong holds, and to open the everlaſting Doors to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the King of Glory, to make a Priſon a Palace, a Slave a Son, and Heir with him of all; with this compare, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.2. <hi>And a man ſhall be a hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempeſt, as Rivers of Water in a dry place, as the ſhadow of a great Rock in a weary Land, and the eyes of them that ſee ſhall not be dim, and the eares of them that hear ſhall hearken, the heart alſo of the raſh ſhall underſtand knowledge, and the Tongue of the ſtammerer ſhall be ready to ſpeak plainly.</hi> Men in their natural condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be in a calm; as long as the ſtrong Man ruleth, all is at peace; but theſe will be in a tempeſt, and a terrible one, firſt or laſt, when their Conſciences come to be convinced, as the Apoſtles here was. And
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:66474:26"/>then who is able? and who is appointed to allay theſe ſtorms? To this the Prophet anſwers.—<hi>A man ſhall be a hiding place, and a covert from wind and rain:</hi> but, ſo a Man, that he is alſo God, or elſe he could do nothing at theſe winds and ſtorms. That theſe things are thus ſpiritually to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, appears by the next words, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>And the eyes of them that ſee ſhall not be dim,</hi> &amp;c. So that it means heart-ſtorms and tempeſt, and heart-help, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> God-Man, that is to be the helper, and the great Covert in theſe ſtorms and tempeſts, and the great Rock for ſhade, where the poor Soul is ſo ſcorched with the heat of God's wrath, that he is ready to faint and die. Blindneſs, and deafneſs, and raſhneſs, they all ſpeak one thing, the ill ſtate we are in by nature, blind, deaf, dumb, and yet raſh, and mad, and confident enough, and the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who is called Emanuel <hi>God with us,</hi> he is the appointed curer of all theſe Maladies.</p>
               <p>This is a proof of the Point in hand in general: I will deſcend to particulars of our fallen ſtate, and ſhew you that Chriſt is the appointed and proper remedy, of all the diſeaſes of our Souls. There are three things complain'd of, and ſuppoſed, in the Apoſtles complaint in my Text, one is a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of death, that is, our natural depraved ſtate, which is the filth of ſin.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He complains of the <hi>Body of this Death,</hi> that is, the obligation of ſin, to the wrath of God, temporal and eternal, which we call the guilt of ſin: Theſe two are expreſſed in his complaint. Now there is a third thing ſuppoſed, in theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of a bad ſtate, which is, that he would fain have a better, or elſe he would not have complained of this, no more than other unregenerated Sinners do. Now as to all theſe three, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the proper and appointed remedy and relief, of miſerable and wretched Man.</p>

When the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had ſaid, that <hi>David</hi> ſhould be their Prince for ever, meaning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he further ſaith, in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this <hi>David,</hi> to wit, Chriſt, — <hi>The Heathen ſhall know that I the Lord do ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Iſrael, when my Sanctuary ſhall be in the midſt of them for ever more,</hi> Ezek. 37.25.28. compared; It is this <hi>Zerubbabel</hi>'s hand, that laid the Foundation, and it is his hand that finiſheth it, and therefore the charge is, that none deſpiſe the little ſmall begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of it, though never ſo ſmall. As <hi>Chriſt</hi> can remove guilt and filth in one day, which is much rubbiſh indeed: So he can make a new Creature as ſoon, if he pleaſe. He made the Thief a new man quickly, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him to Heaven with Him that Day, He made Him, and finiſhed Him, and Houſed Him, and all in a Day; He made but a Days work; nay, but a few Houres work to finiſh Grace and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:66474:30"/>
               <p>Theſe things of the new ſtate doth <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo as not to be undone. <hi>He ſhall not fail, or be diſcouraged, till he have ſet Judgment in the Earth, and the Iles ſhall wait for his Law,</hi> Iſa. 42, 4. There be many diſcouraging things, in the removal of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural corruption, as in any work I know, enough to quench the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> quite, but it ſeemeth, that he is under ſuch a Law; and ſuch an aſſiſtance from the Father, that he muſt know no diſcouragement, but muſt on with the work againſt all oppoſition, and <hi>ſet and eſtabliſh judgment,</hi> that is, the ſtate of the new Creature, or the work of grace; he muſt make the new Creature, and he muſt eſtabliſh it, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo make it, that it may never be marred again, as the Image of God in the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was. <hi>Christ</hi> threw out filth ſo, that the Devil cannot eaſily fetch it in again. And <hi>Chriſt</hi> build ſo upon himſelf the Chief corner Stone, and firm Rock, that no ſtormes can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, <hi>Job</hi> is a great inſtance. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That Charity never faileth;</hi> If our love never fail, it is becauſe that God's love to us in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> never faileth. The love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is unchangeable, and ſo he maketh ours, that much water cannot quench it. <hi>Chriſt ordains us to bring forth much fruit, and our fruit to remain,</hi> Joh. 15.16. When <hi>Polycarp</hi> was ſet on an Aſs, and carried to his doom, he heard a voice from Heaven,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66474:31"/>ſaying, be of good chear, O <hi>Polycarp,</hi> and play the Man, the Speaker no Man ſaw, but the voice was heard by many of us, ſaith the Hiſtory. And if any one did play the Man in his ſuffering, he did. <hi>Have reſpect to thine age, tender thy life; ſwear by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of Caeſar: repent of what is paſt, and ſay remove the wicked.</hi> But he looking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with a ſtedfaſt countenance upon the wicked Multitude, ſaid, <hi>Remove O Lord theſe wicked.</hi> — <hi>Fourſcore and ſix years have I ſerved Chriſt, and he never offended me in any thing; And, how then can I revile my King, that hath thus kept me?</hi> The pro-conſul ſtill urged him, but he ſtill as ſtoutly reſiſted him, and replyed, <hi>I am a Chriſtian;</hi> and there was no turning of him with all that they could ſay or do. The firſt Work of grace in our firſt Parents was loſt, but the grace we now have by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> eating of that Tree of Life, is preſerved for ever, and none can pluck out of his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Chriſt doth this excellent work of the new Creature, alone. But <hi>now once in the end of the World, hath he appeared to put away ſin by the Sacrifice of himſelf,</hi> Heb. 9.26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What ſacrifices ſoever have been uſed, they did not mean, that any could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Man's guilt or filth, but all pointed at Chriſt the ſacrificing of himſelf, and that this, and this alone, is the remedy of fallen
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66474:31"/>and ſinful Man. <hi>He trod the Wine preſs of the wrath of God alone, and of the People none with him,</hi> Iſa. 63.3. <hi>David</hi> duell'd it with <hi>Goliah,</hi> and had nothing but a contemptible weapon, <hi>a Sling, and a Stone.</hi> And ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> duell'd it, with all the Enemies of Man's ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and had nothing but a contemptible weapon, a body ſubject to infirmities. <hi>Chriſt</hi> would not put any of this work, out of his own hands to be done, — <hi>Who his own ſelf bare our ſins, in his own body on the Tree, that we being dead to ſin ſhould live to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by whoſe ſtripes we are healed,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.24. Chriſt had none to help him, to bear the Croſs which God laid on him, though he had one to help bear the Croſs, which Men laid on him. The weight of our ſins, as puniſhed with infinite wrath and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Alaſs, who could bear this Croſs? or be compelled to it? and yet all the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned are compelled to bear this Croſs, and ſo will all reprobates. As in one part of our reſtoration, Chriſt was alone, ſo in all the parts of it, foundation and top-ſtone he layeth both alone, and <hi>none of the People with him.</hi> — None offered to him firſt, not laſt. <hi>Look to Abraham your Father, and to Sarah that bare you, for I called him alone, and increaſed him and bleſſed him,</hi> Iſa. 51.2. I think the ſcope of this Scripture, was to ſtrengthen faith, that though they were but few, yet that God was able to deliver them
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:66474:32"/>from all their Enemies, as he did <hi>Abraham</hi> in a very lonely ſtate in <hi>Canaan,</hi> from the Kings that fought with him. But take the place more ſpiritually and ſtrictly, for Gods calling of him out of the ſtate of Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme, and ſo the bringing him to a ſtate of grace, the bringing him to a new Country and Religion and State, all this God did for <hi>Abraham</hi> alone, and ſubdued all his inward enemies alone; and made him an Heir of Eternal Salvation, alone. God would truſt <hi>Abraham</hi>'s beſt eſtate with none, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>I deſire but this,</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi>) <hi>that Chriſt would take me in hand to cure me, and undertake for a ſick man, I know I ſhould not die under his hand, ſorrow which hath no eyes, hath put a Vail upon my Soul, that I cannot ſee him.</hi> If <hi>Christ</hi> undertake a ſick ſinners cure, let his diſeaſe be what it will, never ſo deſperate, never ſo long ſtanding, he cureth him without any more Phyſicians, and none die under his hand.</p>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Chriſt doth this great ſervice for Man, of making a better ſtate, freely; for <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> for great ſinners and little ſinners, (if there be any ſuch) Chriſt doth all freely: He cured <hi>Naman,</hi> that his skin came, as if it had been the skin of a young Child, and did it for nothing, though a very rich Man, and would have given much for his Cure. Our Fathers had Manna
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66474:32"/>from Heaven, and Phyſick the brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, which cured them and ſupported them for nothing, and all that was Chriſt. The Manna that fed them was Chriſt, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that healed them was Chriſt,—<hi>Where there is neither Greek, nor Jew, circumciſion, nor uncircumciſion, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Chriſt is all, and in all,</hi> Col. 3.11. In all ſorts, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Chriſt works for the Cure of natural corruption, and doth many Cures of this kind, but takes nothing, no mony, nor monys worth, he curſed <hi>Gehazi</hi> that would be medling this way. The <hi>Samaritan</hi> poured in Oil and Wine, and healed the wounded Man of all his wounds, and all freely. And ſo brought the Prophet's Widdow out of debt freely; ſuch <hi>Samaritans</hi> are now much wanting for Prophets Widdows in debt; and he frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgave a Debtor many Talents. GOD lookt upon every of the Five Days Work, and ſaid it was good: But, on the Sixth Days Work, when he had made Man, he beheld, and ſaid it <hi>was very good,</hi> to ſhew what ſpecial delight God had to make his own Image, and to draw his own likeneſs in Man; ſo doth Chriſt ſtill not only do this work of reſtoring fallen Man, and do it for nothing, but delights to conform us to his Image, and when this Days work is done for any wretched Man, he ſaith, <hi>it is very good,</hi> and all the Angels rejoyce with him.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Learn that we are much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to Chriſt, and God, for laying the help of ſuch deſperate Diſeaſes on one ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

My underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is darkned, I know not God, I know not his Son, I know not the Fathers Name, nor the Sons, I know not the Scriptures, both Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are a ſealed Book to me.

A vail is on my heart always as to all theſe neceſſary things to be known. And as my Eyes be boared out like Samſon's, as I have no knowledge, ſo I have leſs affection. I am wholly alienated from the Life of God, no ſpiritual life and heat in my heart, but as dead as Nabal; yea, not only a dead heart, but a ſtony heart, twice dead, ten times dead, nothing will make ſenſe, neither words nor blows, as if I were utterly paſt all capacity of feeling, as a Stone is.</hi> This is the poor and needy ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Water, and finding none.</p>

Honour his ability and all ſufficiency, to do as great Cures as yours is, though you have not faith enough to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his willingneſs to undertake your caſe. So did the poor Leper.—<hi>Lord, if thou wilt I know thou art able to make me whole,</hi>— Me though a Leper; God thy Father hath highly exalted thee, and given thee a Name above every name, Power and ability above all to open Priſons, to lead Captivity Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to relieve the Poor, to bind up broken hearted: Thou canſt whip out all the Worldly luſts which ſwarm in my heart, all the mony-changing thoughts, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which make my Soul common, and lean, and ill favoured. There be many great and precious Promiſes which God hath made, and the ſcope of them is, that I ſhould be cleanſed from all filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit, and have a Divine and holy nature, given me, and thou O Chriſt art to make all theſe Promiſes, yea and Amen unto me, and art able to do it, if thou wilt, yea even in my very filthy Soul, Why then is it not done? Touching <hi>Chriſt's</hi> ability, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.5. <hi>And every Plant before it was in the Earth, and every Herb before it grew, for the Lord had not made it to rain, and there was not a Man to Till the ground.</hi> The meaning is, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Creator of all things, the Eternal Word by which the Father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:66474:39"/>all things to be, was not behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Nature or Art, to make any thing that was made, or to preſerve it when made; he made the Plants and Herbs before they were in the Earth, that is, he gave the Earth ſuch a formative Vertue, to ſhape ſuch Plants, and Flowers in her Womb, and then without Rain, or Man's Tillage and dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, did he preſerve theſe, for Man nor Rain were not yet created, when theſe Plants and Herbs were actually in Beeing: by his bare Word did he both make all Plants and Herbs, and by the ſame bare Word, without Rain or Tillage of Man, did he make them grow and ſubſiſt: Such is the Power of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Word, as to any diſtreſs of the Soul, to raiſe the dead, to cure the lame and blind.</p>

               <p>Motives particularly to preſs you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and follow theſe Exhortations, are theſe three. <hi>Firſt,</hi> You who groan and ſigh with this Apoſtle, <hi>O wretched Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that I am,</hi> &amp;c. You are particularly and ſpecially invited, as it were by name, to come to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to truſt that he is both able and willing, yea and cannot do otherwiſe, but relieve you, who ever he paſſeth by, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are wearied and heavy loaded, and ye ſhall finde reſt to your Souls.</hi> The Promiſe expreſſes to all ſuch as you, that ye ſhall finde relief, full relief, reſt to your reſtleſs Souls, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.28. In this Promiſe, obſerve the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality of the Invitement. — <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy loaded; i. e.</hi> which cry out, as the Apoſtle in my

Therefore as the Apoſtle ſaith as to his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, ſo ſay I, as to his will.— <hi>Having ſuch a High Prieſt, let us draw nigh with a true heart, in full aſſurance of faith.</hi> So ſay I, <hi>having ſuch a merciful High Prieſt;</hi> yea, and having ſuch a high and precious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, let all burdened and heart-loaded ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners draw nigh to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with full aſſurance of faith, that he will give them reſt. Where promiſes are ſo particularly directed, it is much indulgence, and as a ſtretching out the Hand and Scepter to <hi>Eſther,</hi> to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and embolden the trembling doubting ſinner, yea it is as the Father of the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals, beholding him afar off, and running to meet him.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not meerly under the Bond of his Promiſe to relieve ſuch, though this he cannot break, as he cannot lie, but he is under the bond of much affection in this work. <hi>Husbands love your Wives, as Chriſt loved his Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and cleanſe it, with the waſhing of water by the Word, that he might preſent it to himſelf ſpotleſs,</hi> Epheſ. 5.26. No Husband can with

Some are bound faſt enough to a buſineſs by their word, but not at all by their affection, and theſe though they keep their word, yet it is in ſuch a rough churliſh way, as is much diſcouraging; but it is not ſo with Chriſt, becauſe he is under the bond of his bowels and affections, as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the bond of his word, and therefore truſt in him, that your caſe ſhall be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and very carefully and compaſſionately helped.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He general Mortality of Man-kind, and the Holy Uſe that ſhould be made thereof, by all the living, are the two principal things of this verſe. Death takes away the wicked, and doubtleſs the wicked and others too, ſhould lay this to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:66474:44"/>heart; for Death is no partial Viſitor, if it fetch off one wicked Man, and ſend him to his place, it will fetch down another; nothing is more naturally the wages of wickedneſs, than death; and yet no worſe enemy to any wicked Man, than death; therefore one wicked Man ſhould be ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led much, at the death of another.</p>
               <p>But Death ſometimes taketh away all Men, and then all Men, bad and good, ſhould be much moved, then all ſhould lay to heart this, <hi>i.e.</hi> ſhould be ſenſible of their ſin, and the diſpleaſure of God, and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, make peace with him, by repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that ſo preſent evils, and alſo future preſaged by preſent ſtrokes, may be turned away; which thing, this People could not be ſtirred up unto, which was the reaſon of the complaint of this Prophet: he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Funerals of the dead, the beſt dead, to the living good and bad, but <hi>no man laid it to heart:</hi> that is, not held themſelves deeply concerned, to look about them, to ſearch their Souls, to ſet Houſe and Heart in order to die, but kept on every one in his wonted pace of ſin, and wickedneſs, and formality in Religion, and ſo fell moſt of them in the common calamity.</p>
               <p>The Doctrines which may be obſerved in theſe words, are theſe. <hi>Firſt, That God
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:66474:44"/>ſometimes by common calamity taketh away the good as well as the bad: Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> as well as the mixed Multitude, which murmured, Did the Lord take off, and would not let them come in to the good Land.— <hi>The righteous Man periſheth,</hi> as if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had ſaid, the Lord ſtrikes more mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally than any one is well aware, he plucks up the ſtakes in the Hedg, he pulls down the Pillars of the whole Nation, and yet Men do not fear, that all will fall about their Ears. Hence it is that another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, calls upon the beſt People to look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, and to labour to be much better, yet gives them but a <hi>may be</hi> for their ſafety. <hi>Seek meekneſs all ye meek of the Earth, ye which have wrought his judgments, ſeek meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſeek righteouſneſs, it may be ye ſhall be hid in the day of the Lord's wrath.</hi> As if the Prophet had ſaid, I cannot enſure the life of the beſt Man, becauſe God ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth the righteous with the wicked, for ends beſt known to himſelf. This ſhould make us all fear and tremble much in this dying Day, and to give all diligence to make our Calling and Election ſure, and to be getting Oyl into our Lamps, yea and to keep them trim'd, and to ſtand guirt, and ready to go in with the Bride-groom, if call'd at Mid-night, by the deſtroying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel that is now abroad.</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:66474:45"/>
               <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Doctrin that may be obſerved in theſe words, is this, <hi>That gracious Men and merciful are the likelieſt to ſcape beſt, in times of common calamity</hi> The Prophet ſeems to note it in theſe words of my Text, as very ſevere Juſtice, that gracious and merciful Men ſhould not be diſtinguiſhed from others, in the Day of evil.—<hi>The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Man periſheth, and merciful Men are taken away.</hi> As if the Prophet had ſaid, now the Lord is very angry indeed, that he will not ſpare ſuch as theſe, which are ſo precious in his eye, if any be. <hi>Noah</hi> a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Man, was preſerved from the <hi>Flood.</hi> And <hi>Lot</hi> a righteous Man, preſerved and plucked out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and had there been <hi>Ten</hi> righteous more, the Cities might have been ſaved for their ſake, as the Ship full of Paſſengers for <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſake. And <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> the Black more, a merciful Man, was ſaved from the deſtructions which deſtroyed <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and ſo was <hi>Jeremiah.</hi> This ſhould incite all People, as they love their lives in this dying day, to labour after grace, and to be merciful Men and Women, yea boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in this day of want, for ſuch as are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to yield themſelves thus to the Scepter of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to follow him fully, with all they have and are, will certainly ſcape beſt; ſuch as yield all to the Lord, will ſave all, if any do. You that become of prophane, righteous and holy Men, you take the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:66474:45"/>way, I know, to eſcape well in this mortal time; If you get not your lives, you will get your Souls for a Prey, no Plague ſhall come nigh that, thus are you lodged ſafe in the Promiſe, as ſoon as you become gracious, and break off from your wicked ways, by repentance. And you that are gracious and godly, think on't, as you love your lives in this day of mortality ſhew your Faith by your Works, abound in this gift alſo of mercifulneſs, many that are able and carry the Bag, are abroad and I fear have carr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed the Bag with them; you that are here, had need be the more merciful, Man's poor will ſtarve elſe. Surely ſuch as are ready to preſerve the lives of others, God will preſerve their lives.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Third</hi> Doctrin, that may be obſerved in theſe words, is this, <hi>That times of general ſecurity, under preſent leſſer puniſhments, are of very evil preſage.</hi> If when God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are in the Earth, righteous Men and merciful be taken away, and none lay theſe drops of the ſtorms to heart, it fore-rells ſurely that the Storm will come, and fall hard, and Thunder, and Hall much. Surely ſome great Evils are at Door, when little ones are made light of: though I cannot call the taking away of one righteous Man in this day, nor the taking away of one merciful Man or Woman in this day, a little
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:66474:46"/>puniſhment.<note place="margin">Dictum cum vulgo.</note> I ſpeak after you, if leſſer Rods make no Body feel, great ones ſurely are a making.—Righteous Men are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and none conſider, that they are taken from great Evil to come.</p>
               <p>Sometimes with a fooliſh Virgins ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the good become bad in this, that they lay not GOD's dealings to heart as they ſhould, but let Death, like a Moth, ſtilly take away one, and then another, and make no noiſe in Heaven about it; good People are much in a hurry with this World, one about his Farm, and another about his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, and whilſt running here and there, hither and thither, the King of <hi>Syria</hi> is gone, the matters which ſhould have been cloſe kept to the heart, are ſlipt away out of the mind, and made no uſe of. And ſuch a temper among the Lord's People, as well as others, is a ſure fore-runner of ſome rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing Judgment at Door, that may well awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken every Body: the Storm begins to come in among you Citizens now, I hope you will be awake anon, the Plague hath kept in the out-parts a good while, O that we in the in-parts within theſe Walls, had been well awake then, and laid matters to heart then as we ſhould!</p>
               <p>The Doctrin which I would ſtand on, is this, <hi>That general Mortality ſhould be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally laid to heart. Mortal ſtrokes upon all,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:66474:46"/>good as well as bad, ſhould much affect all good and bad.</hi> The Strokes of God in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's time, when he ſpake the words of my Text, began to be general, God ſpared not righteous nor wicked, and God thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly ſmiting, the Prophet was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that Men were no more affected, as well he might. From whence I obſerve, <hi>That general Mortality, ſhould be generally laid to heart.</hi> No Man, high or low, good or bad, but ſhould much lay to heart all the ſtrokes of God, which bring death, that great blow to Man's Beeing. Mortality by Plague, Sword, Famine, or any other way, or by any other Diſeaſe, ſhould be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and well made uſe of, eſpecially if it reach the righteous, as well as others. <hi>The Lion hath roared, who will not fear? The Lord God hath ſpoken, who can but Propheſie? Amos</hi> 3.8. Nature teacheth this in all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that when ſuch Creatures of prey are abroad, which they know they are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of to be preyed upon, to dread and tremble, and to take all care they can, to ſhun them, and to ſave themſelves. The Prophet <hi>Mica,</hi> who Propheſied in the ſame time with <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which ſo complained in my Text, complaineth juſt like him, and almoſt in the ſame words, <hi>Mica</hi> 7.2. <hi>The good Man is periſhed out of the Earth, and there is none upright among Men they all lie in wait for blood, they hunt every Man his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66474:47"/>with a Net,</hi> &amp;c. As if the Prophet had ſaid, Good men periſh out of the Earth, and this is ſo far from being laid to heart, and lookt upon as any judgment, that all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences are uſed to take away the reſt, every one lieth in wait for blood, yea the blood of his Brother, as <hi>Cain</hi> lay in wait for his Brothers blood, And where will this end? And by this grief of this Prophet, I gather that general Mortality, the periſhing of good Men, and the periſhing of others, by violences, and murders, and ſuch like, ought much to affect the living, and not the lives of all ſorts to be taken away, and made no more of, than of Dogs, or Hogs, by the death of which there is an advantage. By this Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> we may ſee this Doctrin again confirmed, that general ſtrokes ſhould generally affect, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64 9 10, 11. <hi>Be not wrath very ſoon, O Lord, neither remember iniquity for ever, behold, we beſſech thee, we are all thy People.

                  </gap>n theſe words ſpeaketh prophetically, and beholdeth and repreſenteth that which was to be as done, namely the deſtruction and deſolation of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that ſtate, Perſons and things, one and all, and how doth he ſpeak of this general Mortality of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:66474:47"/>Perſons and things, good and bad, high and low? Doth he ſpeak of it ſlightly? O no, but with much complaint, and ſtrong cry, and bemoans to God. <hi>Be not wrath very ſore, O Lord, be not angry for ever, Zion is a Deſolation, Jeruſalem a Wilderneſs,</hi> &amp;c. In theſe Deſolations, as you know by the Scripture, there was Death by Plague, Sword and Famine; then I conclude, that general Mortality, ſhould be generally laid to heart, for the Prophet did thus complain to God, to affect all Men, that they might ſo complain to God, as he did, how ſadly matters went amongſt them. Take one Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture more <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.6. <hi>And from the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Zion, all her beauty is departed, her Princes are become like Harts, that can finde no paſture, and they are gone without ſtrength before the Purſuer.</hi> This Prophet layeth to heart particularly the diſtreſſes of Princes, and great Men; and alaſs, what are all theſe, to the diſtreſſes, and death of the righteous, and holy, and merciful Men; which proves that we ſhould lay to heart the common ſtrokes of God, as the Sword and Peſtilence take away one as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, bad and good, high and low.</p>
               <p>I will prove this Point more particularly and diſtinctly to you. <hi>Firſt,</hi> We are to lay to heart Mortality by the Peſtilence. <hi>I have ſent among you the Peſtilence after the manner
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:66474:48"/>of Aegypt, your Horſes have I taken away, and have made the stink of your Camps to come up into your Noſthrils, and ſo killed you with Plagues, and Diſeaſes,</hi> attending the Sword, <hi>and yet ye have not returned to me, Amos</hi> 4.10. that is, you have not laid things to heart throughly, to be aſhamed of your evil ways, and to turn from them. The death of Men, nay the death of Horſes, (as ſuch deaths not long ſince were amongſt them) we are to lay to heart, and ſo to lay to heart, as to prepare to meet God: then the death of good Men by the Peſtilence we are ſurely to lay to heart. <hi>From above hath he ſent a Fire into my Bones, and it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed againſt them, he hath made me deſolate and faint all the day, Lam.</hi> 1.13. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in theſe words, as in all the reſt, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonateth the ſtate of the People generally, and much laid to heart GOD's immediate ſtrokes upon the Perſons of Men, by many mortal fierce Diſeaſes, without ſparing any, —<hi>From above hath he ſent Fire into my Bones, and it hath prevailed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Mortality by Famine is to be laid to heart. The Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> ſpeaketh of this ſtroke, which indeed is great. — <hi>The Land is as the Garden of Eden before them, and behind them a deſolate Wilderneſs, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall eſcape them, ſpeaking of Vermin ſo devouring all Man's Proviſion,</hi> Joel 2.3.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:66474:48"/>at the 12th. verſ. of this Chapter the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet telleth us what effect this ſhould have. <hi>Therefore now alſo ſaith the Lord, turn ye to me with all your heart, and with faſting, weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and with mourning, rent your hearts, and not your Garments, for he is gracious, who knoweth if he will return and repent.</hi> By which of theſe ſtrokes either Peſtilence or Famine, the godly were taken away, no Man can ſay; for, by Peſtilence, Famine, and Sword, did the Lord contend with that People; That he contended with them by Famine, the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> and alſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> teſtifieth, <hi>They have ſowen Wheat, and ſhall reap Thorns, they have put themſelves to pain, but ſhall not profit</hi> (thus doth the Prophet, <hi>poſcere aciem, bid battel</hi>) <hi>and ye ſhall be aſhamed of your revenue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the fierce anger of the Lord,</hi> Jer. 12. 13. But moſt plain in <hi>Ezek.</hi> c. 4. &amp; 5. Where the Prophet is commanded to make Bread with Beans and Fitches, and to eat this by weight, and to mix dung with it. And muſt this be laid to heart? Yes, much: How can any do otherwiſe? <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, ſmite with the Hand, and ſtamp with the Foot, and ſay, alaſs for all the evil abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Houſe of Iſrael, for they ſhall fall by the Sword, by the Famine, and by the Peſtilence,</hi> Ezek. 6.11. Then they fell by all theſe, and then it is probable that the righteous fell by all theſe, as others; then
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:66474:49"/>we ſhould lay to heart Mortality by all theſe; we ſhould <hi>ſmite with the Hand, and ſtamp with the Foot, and ſay alaſs.</hi> What great abom nations have cauſed all theſe great Judgments? God's temporal ſtrokes and judgments, which kill and ſlaughter all ſorts, ſhould much be laid to heart by all ſorts.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay,<note place="margin">Q.</note> What is it to lay to heart, the mortal ſtrokes of GOD in a Nation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I anſwer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A.</note> It is to be deeply ſenſible of the cauſe, as it may be in our ſelves, or in the Nation wherein we live. Obſerve how the Lord counſelleth <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to carry it, in the day of their dreadful miſery.— <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, ſmite with thine Hand, and ſtamp with thy Foot, and ſay alaſs for all the evil abominations of the Land of Iſrael:</hi> He doth not barely bid him to ſay, alaſs for all the evil puniſhments of the Land, as Sword, Peſtilence, and Famine, but alaſs for all the wickedneſs of the Land, which hath cauſed theſe. <hi>He that is far off ſhall fall by the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, and he that is neer ſhall fall by the Sword, and he that remains, and is beſieged ſhall die by Famine,</hi> Ezek. 6.11.12. So that to lay to heart mortal ſtrokes in a Nation, is to be deeply affected with the cauſe of them, in our ſelves, or in others.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:66474:49"/>
               <p>If you ask me further, where we have found out cauſes in our ſelves, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and in others <hi>quos accidam?</hi> as <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſaith,</p>
               <p>To whom ſhall I turn and proſtrate my ſelf? and ſay, I have ſinn'd,<note place="margin">Q.</note> and done this evil abomination?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To God, in the Name of Chriſt.<note place="margin">A.</note> 
                  <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord, turn you even unto me, with all your heart and with faſting, and with weeping, and with mourning,</hi> Joel 2.12. And to do this forth-with, preſently without all delay or elſe to be ſure it is not turning to the Lord with all the heart. To lay to heart God's willing Diſcipline, is to be full of deep ſorrow for ſin in our ſelves, and others as the proper cauſes of all ſorts of deaths, and deaths of all ſorts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, good and bad, and to turn from theſe to the Lord, and to believe on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that the Lord for his ſake will be pacified, and turn away all his diſpleaſure, and not make us a reproach unto the Heathen, as it is in that Chapter, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.17.</p>
               <p>Having thus proved and opened the Doctrin, I will ſhew you in the next Place,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſes. </seg>
                  </label> what Uſe may be made of it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> This Point is profitable to teach. If we are to be deeply ſenſible of temporal ſtrokes, ſuch as refer to the death of our bodies, then much more are we to be ſenſible of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:66474:50"/>ſtrokes, and eternal ſtrokes, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the death of our Souls. <hi>I will ſend a Famine, not of Bread, but of hearing the Word of the Lord. And they ſhall wander from Sea to Sea, and from the North to the Eaſt, they ſhall run to and fro to ſeek the Word of the Lord, and ſhall not finde it, Amos</hi> 8.11, 12. How diligently we get the Bills of Mortality now, and being come up to Thouſands, O how we lift up our hands, but who brings in Weekly Bills of our Death of Souls, by the Famine of the Word, of hearing the Word of the Lord, in City and Country? A great deal of do ſeems to be, about the death of Bodies, but ah Lord, how many Thouſand, Thouſand Souls, have periſhed in this City, and in theſe Nations, in a few years paſt, for want of hearing the Word of the Lord, that is able to ſave the Soul! <hi>Be not wrath very ſoar, ſee, behold, we are thy People, Zion is a Wilderneſs, Jeruſalem a Deſolation, and all our pleaſant things are ſcattered, Will the Lord refrain for theſe things?</hi> Herein the Prophet ſeems to be toucht to the quick, that <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was deſolate, and all theſe Soul-pleaſant things were ſpoiled, whereby Souls ſtarved and periſhed, and Soul-Famine, and Peſtilence was made, a Famine of hearing the Word of the Lord, that whither ſoever they went, from one City to another, from one Sea to another,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:66474:50"/>'twas all alike; This, this the Prophet laid deeply to heart, and ſo ſhould we; I urge it by way of proportion, if we ſhould deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay to heart bodily death, then much more Soul-death and deſtruction. <hi>A fide ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitans, puniendus,</hi> ſaith the Civilian, ſuch as play the wanton, from the truth, muſt be puniſhed anſwerably. We have been, and yet ſtill are, <hi>a fide exorbitantes,</hi> ſuch as play the unruly Perſons from the truth, Children of <hi>Belial,</hi> which cannot bear Chriſt's Yoke, full of Soul-itch for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goſpel, and being thus lewd in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals, anſwerably in ſpiritual liberties and enjoyments hath God puniſhed us; it is not a little peril unto us, that we meet now, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the hand of God affright ſuch, as would be looking after us; This, this we ſhould deeply lay to heart, that the Bread for our Souls fails, from the Houſe of our God. The ſtrokes of God, and the ſtrokes of Men together, affright away the Paſtors, and ſo the Paſtures of your Souls, and yet all this but the juſt puniſhment of much ſpiritual wantonneſs and exorbitancy.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If temporal ſtrokes which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the death of the body, ſhould be laid much to heart, then Eternal ſtrokes, which make the everlaſting deſtruction of the Soul, ſhould be deeply laid to heart much more. Such a ſtroke as that, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63.17.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:66474:51"/>
                  <hi>O Lord, Why haſt thou made us to erre from thy ways?</hi> and hardened our hearts from thy fear? and ſuch as that, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.10. <hi>A reproof entereth more into a wiſe Man, than an hundred ſtripes into a Fool.</hi> Some Mens hearts are by the inward ſtrokes of GOD made Judgment-proof, that Plague, Famine and Sword, all the Ten Plagues that were inflicted on <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and Ten more to them, will not ſtir them, nor turn them, no more than they ſtopped or turned him, nor yet ſo much. And what do you ſee in this day, done on the hearts of Men by the hand of God abroad, now, of Sword, Famine, and Peſtilence? Do theſe enter the hearts of Men? This ſpeaks that Eternal ſtrokes, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial wrath upon the Soul is abroad, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men for Eternal death much, of which I fear the moſt of us, are little aware. <hi>O Jureſalem, Jeruſalem, how oft would I have gathered thee, as a Hen her Chicken, and thou wouldſt not, but now they are hid from thine Eyes.</hi> This was a Soul-mortal, and an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtroke, and how <hi>Chriſt</hi> laid it to heart! how he ſighed and wept! <hi>O Jeruſalem.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:66474:52"/>for our learning, that we ſhould follow the foot-ſteps of the Flock.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The next Uſe of this Point may be for Reproof, and it may reprove two ſorts. 1. Such as are ſenſible of nothing. 2. Such as are ſenſible of nothing to purpoſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> This may reprove ſuch as are ſenſible of nothing, or nothing ſenſible. Temporal ſtrokes are thick, God and Man upon us, Peſtilence at home, War abroad, God and Man killing and ſlaughtering us, one at Sea, 'tother at land, Is not this general Mortality? God ſhoots his Arrows every where, and how great is his dread fallen upon us! In what Street of this poor City can one walk, but dead Corps and Ghoſts walk; In what Fields about this City can one walk, where death alſo doth not walk, and as God's Bailiff, ſeize and arreſt, and carry away, to the great Bar above, and to the Judge of all the World, to receive all
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:66474:52"/>that they have done here in the Body, good or bad? At what corner of this City, can we that live abroad creep in, and not be met and ſaluted with trains of dead Corps, carrying to the Grave, to new Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and New-exchanges, old Burying-places being over-fatted and glutted, and Corps inhumanely crowding one another out of their Places, before the time; and among all theſe ſad ſalutations, ſome righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Men, and merciful Men and Women taken away, and we can tell their names, and where they lived, and ſo ends the ſtory till the next Bill of Mortality come out, with more taken away, and then they put out the talk of the other, and this is our laying of matters to heart, which is rather a laying them to our Heads and Tongues, than to our Hearts: What change do all your New-exchanges make? He that was a Drunkard, is ſo ſtill: He that was an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer, is ſo ſtill: And he that was an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, and a Formaliſt, is ſo ſtill. They that were malicious to the righteous Man, and to the merciful Man, are ſo ſtill. Is it not at our peril even now, to meet to Preach and Pray, as we do at this time? And have not righteous and merciful once, been hunted from Praying, even in this Plague-time? And is not this our laying to heart general Mortality? May not God well take thoſe home to himſelf, of whom
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:66474:53"/>we are ſo weary? <hi>Who gave Jacob for a ſpoil, and Iſrael to the Robbers? Did not the Lord, He, againſt whom we have ſinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient to his Law. Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of Battel, and hath ſet him on fire round about, yet he knew not, and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart,</hi> Iſa. 42.25.

As if the Prophet had ſaid, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you ſend for ſome artificial mourning, here will be no mourning at all, for all that God hath threatned or executed, every ones heart is ſo dead and ſtone-hard; and juſt ſo it is now with the moſt of us, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Plague of the heart, is much more numerous, than the Plague upon our Bodies.

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Such are to be reproved, who lay things to heart a little, but nothing to purpoſe; as when the Plague is come neer them, or when they meet the white Rod, and the black followers upon Neighbours, nay, upon ſtrangers ſhoulders; for fear the dead ſhould infect their living Friends, then they ſtand and ſtare, and lift up their Eyes and Hands, O what a doleful ſight is this! and others concerned for their Relations, weep a while, and wring their hands.—<hi>No Mother loſt ſuch a Child.</hi> But as for ſin the cauſe of all this, Who cries out of this? Who turns from this? Or, who enquires after Chriſt, to take hold of him, to make his peace with God, that theſe mortal quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels might ceaſe? How many converts by

The <hi>Dutch</hi> Notes are worth your peruſal, upon theſe words. The fowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſinners were committed by great ones, and if any offered to reprove theſe, and ſeek to bring them to the ſenſe of their evil ways, they were ſure to be ſilenced, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe puniſhed, ſo far were that People, from laying any thing to heart.

A little laying to heart of late hath ſeemed to be, by commanding Fire to be made in all Streets, and this, and this I fear, is as I have ſaid, a little ſenſe of God's hand, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66474:54"/>to very little purpoſe. It muſt be other Bon-fires to purge the Heavens, to clear the higheſt Heavens.

               <p>If ye ſay that ye have no calamity in your Families, nor Death in your Houſes, yet Death is much in the dwellings of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; How do ye lay this to heart? God doth whip ſome upon others backs, and this is tender mercy, and ſhould be the more
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66474:55"/>melting, and abaſing, and drawing to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as Cords of great love; Is it thus with you? How the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was affected with the calamity of others, eſpecially as he ſaw it did no good upon their Souls, which was an evident token, how well it wrought upon his Soul; though others ſmarted, yet he laid to heart, and profited. <hi>My bowels, my bowels, I am pained at my very heart, my heart maketh a noiſe in me, I cannot hold my peace, becauſe thou haſt heard, O my Soul, the ſound of the trumpet, and the alarum of War. Deſtruction upon deſtruction is cryed, for the whole Land is ſpoiled, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly are my Tents ſpoiled, and my Curtains in a moment; How long ſhall I ſee the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, and hear the ſound of the Trumpet? for my People is fooliſh, they have not known me, they are ſottiſh Children, they have no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, they are wiſe to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge,</hi> Jer. 4.19, 20. Let us apply theſe words to our ſelves, do not we lie in ſuch an ill frame of Spirit? Are not our hearts (though God's hand be ſo heavy) ſtill ſottiſh and ſenſleſs of all that whereby we have provoked God, to do all this againſt us? Very wiſe and quick to ſee the Moat in others Eyes, and to lay the blame at others doors. You will ſay, ſo did <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> in this Scripture which you have quoted. <hi>I anſwer,</hi> That the Prophet did ſee provocations abroad, it is true, but that it
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:66474:56"/>was not without looking well to his own heart; ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3. <hi>Righteous art thou O Lord, when I plead with thee, yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth the way of the wicked proſper? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are all they happy, which deal very trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly? Thou haſt planted them, yea they have taken root, they grow, yea they bring forth fruit, thou art neer in their mouths, and far from their Reins; but, thou O Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt me, and ſeen me, and tryed my heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, pull them out like Sheep for the ſlaughter, and prepare them for the Day of ſlaughter.</hi> As if he had ſaid, thou knoweſt right well that I have frailties and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties many, yet thou alſo knoweſt that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail them, and in all things I endeavour to approve my ſelf to thee by thy help, and would do nothing to provoke thee in this Day. Can we thus approve our ſelves to GOD now?</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let me exhort you to lay to heart the import of theſe general ſtrokes, that one and all are ſo cut off, wicked and righteous. Theſe kind of general ſtrokes do import, that we all have ſinn'd, and have much provoked God, one as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Righteous Men, and merciful Men, have not been ſo holy and righteous, and ſo merciful as we ſhould. Behold, the Days come, ſaith the Lord, <hi>That I will puniſh the circumciſed with the uncircumciſed. Aegypt and Juda, and ſo puts</hi> them together, and then <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> with them which are in the uttermoſt parts of the Earth, <hi>For all theſe Nations are uncircumciſed in Fleſh, and all the Houſe of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:66474:57"/>Iſrael are uncircumciſed in heart,</hi> Jer. 9.25.26. Some Men are outwardly and openly ſtark naught, and the beſt of us it ſeems are not ſo good at heart as we ſhould be; this let us lay to heart all of us. Or elſe the import of this general mortality is, that God means to harden the hearts of ſome much, by ſlaying the good as well as the bad, that they who have no mind to repent and change their courſes, may be confirmed and encouraged in them, in as much as they ſee, that they eſcape as well as others, and live as long as others. The World is draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on apace to Atheiſme, and the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God ſeems to rock the Cradle. The Idolater and the ſincere worſhiper, the ſuperſtitious and the truly tender conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; <hi>Nabal</hi> and the merciful <hi>Abigail,</hi> all die promiſcuouſly; Why, who can tell now which to prefer to follow? That one may think his Religion as good as the other, the the Papiſt and Proteſtant both die of the Plague; and that the ceremoneiſt may think as well of his way, as the ſtrict Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, they both die of the Plague, and this is a Plague indeed to ſome; this is raining ſnares upon Men, which are willing to ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in their own ways. Some are afraid to be over-righteous, and over-ſtrict, and the judgments of God falling ſo promiſcuouſly, will make ſuch very temperate in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; If this be the import of God's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:66474:58"/>righteous and wicked, to harden ſlight and looſe Profeſſors, we had need look well to it, who profeſs the Goſpel, that we be very ſubſtantial and real, and that we be not catcht with this ſnare of judging by outward appearance, but look to the Word, what that requires. This ſnare the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Ye have wearied the Lord with your words, and yet ye ſay, wherein have we wearied him? When ye ſay that every one that doth evil is good in the ſight of the Lord;</hi> or, <hi>Where is the God of judgment?</hi> Surely the Lord likes our good fellowſhip, and all the latitudes we uſe, and carnal contents and pleaſures, as well as their rigid ſtrict ſelf-denying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, or elſe he would not ſpare us as much or more than he doth them; lay to heart this import of GOD's promiſcuous dealing above all, how God hardens ſinners in their ſins by ſuch dealings.</p>
               <p>Or <hi>Thirdly,</hi> and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> This promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dealing of God imports, that which my Text here tells us, that there are greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils to come, which God takes the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous from, and this ſhould be much laid to heart indeed, according to the very letter of my Text. So was <hi>Joſia</hi> by a leſs judgment, taken from a greater. <hi>A praeſenti praeſumitur, circa futura,</hi> ſaith the Civilian. From pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent things, we may preſume concerning fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:66474:58"/>If <hi>Lot</hi> be warned and pulled out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> there is ſurely ſome great and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtorm a coming. If God ſnatch his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as he did <hi>Joſia,</hi> in haſt (as it were) to Heaven, we may ſay with this Prophet in my Text, they are taken from the evil to come. Lay to heart therefore the hand of God, that it ſlayes ſo generally one and all; and lay to heart the import of it, that it boads ſome greater evil to come. There be Serpents which have heads in their tails, called <hi>Amphiſbaenae.</hi> This ſtroke of God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away righteous and wicked, hath a head in the tail of it, that will make worſe work, than this head which is now fore-moſt, and yet how many doth this fore-moſt head now ſmite and ſlay! and how mortal and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous is this <hi>fore-head!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Be exhorted to lay to heart this, that you may be the next cut off, who ever you be, ſeeing the ſlaughter men in this day ſpare none, young nor old, rich nor poor, cloſe Lanes, nor open Streets, righteous nor wicked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What ſhould we all then ſay to our ſelves, but this, ſurely I may be next the mark which God will hit. What a trade the Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin-makers, and Grave-makers now have? And Hell anſwerably doubly inlargeth it ſelf, as you do now ſeek out for new Church Yards; and ſhould not we ſmite on our breaſts, and ſay, O the wonderful mercy and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:66474:59"/>power, and patience of the Lord, that none of all theſe have been employed about me yet! That ſo many thouſands ſhould be gone before, and ſo many thouſands more draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, and drawing after, and I yet not one of theſe; O magnified be the rich and Soveraign mercy of God! Am I more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, more merciful, more uſeful with my Talent than ſuch, and ſuch that are gone? O no: not worthy to be named in the Day with them, and yet that I ſhould be left, and they taken, that they ſhould have their turn, their over-turn before me!</p>
               <p>When I ſay, lay to heart, that you may be next, I mean more than one thing, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring of GOD's mercy, that you are yet ſpared; I mean this alſo, lay to heart your ſtate, whether you be ready. <hi>I was wroth with my People: I have polluted mine Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and given them into thine hand: thou didſt ſhew them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid the yoke. And thou ſaidſt, I ſhall be a Lady for ever: ſo that thou didſt not lay theſe things to thy heart, neither didſt remember the latter end of it, Iſa.</hi> 47.6, 7. Many parts of the Chriſtian World are given into the hands of Men, and they do with them at their pleaſure, and yet are ſecure, and conſider not the end of ſuch ways, that it will be bitterneſs at laſt. I have nothing to do with ſuch but with you.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:66474:59"/>Are not you yet in ſome ways which are not good, and yet promiſe peace to your ſelves in them, yea though GOD's ſlaughter-men and Fellers be come up to <hi>London,</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A <hi>Second</hi> Motive to preſs you to lay to heart theſe times, is alſo in the Text.

If we be yet ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and walk contrary, ſurely we ſhall be puniſhed <hi>Seven</hi> times more; 'tis an ill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, as to the whole Nation, that God may be laying an Axe to the Root of all. <hi>My heritage is to me as a ſpeckled Bird, the Birds round about are againſt her, aſſemble all ye Beaſts of the Field, come to devour, they have made it deſolate, and it being deſolate mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to me, the whole Land is made deſolate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man layeth it to heart, Jer.</hi> 12.9, 10, 11.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A <hi>Third</hi> Motive is this, lay to heart pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent mortal ſtrokes, or elſe you will be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed with thoſe that are to come, elſe the evils approaching, will juſtly overtake you unawares. You will (as the fool) be ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a requiem to your ſouls, <hi>Soul take thine eaſe and be quiet;</hi> thou haſt got a good Air to dwell in, and all Neighbours about us be well yet, there is not one ſick of the Plague in all the Pariſh; and thou haſt got an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent receit againſt the Plague, ſuch and ſuch uſed it all the laſt great Plague, and were all well, on ſome ſuch Lees will you ſettle, and ſo be ſurpriſed with God's Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. <hi>I will viſit them that are ſetled upon

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> You are the Men and Women which have ſeen afflictions, as the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaid, <hi>I am the Man that have ſeen affliction by the Rod of his wrath,</hi> Lam. 3.1. You have not only read the Bills, but you have been at the Burials, you have been of the Mourners that have gone about the Streets: You have ſeen the black trains of dead Corſes, going by Sixes and Tens to their long home, therefore your eyes ſhould affect and afflict your hearts; Alaſs, if we
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:66474:62"/>here in the midſt of ſo many Thouſand deaths, be Soul-dead, and lay nothing to heart, how is it likely that they in the Country, which ſee none of theſe Sermons, ſhould be deeply affected. They have ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Word to quicken them in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and you have the Word and the Rod, and the Marks of the Rod upon your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and upon the Bodies of yours, the Marks of the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> wrath, you that have ſuch feeling Sermons, and not feel, how will this be cryed out upon! GOD that is come ſo neer to judge, you that have been ſo neer the Grave, if not Hell, that have dwelt in <hi>Golgotha,</hi> among nothing but Tombes, Graves, Sculs, and lean walking Ghoſtes for ſo many Moneths this Year, when others have been out of the ſight and hearing of all theſe things, if you weep not to them, 'tis very unlikely that they will weep unto you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finally,</hi> This duty of laying to heart the promiſcuous mortal ſtrokes of God, is a duty, wherein God will help you, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed you, therefore up, and be at it. God hath promiſed <hi>to take away the heart of ſtone, and to give a heart of Fleſh: and that with weeping, and ſupplication he will lead us:</hi> And therefore we ſhould wait upon the Word in theſe his ways, becauſe he will meet us, and aſſiſt us in the work of this
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:66474:63"/>day. And God will not only aſſiſt, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and proſper this work of humiliation. <hi>I have heard Ephraim bemoaning himſelf thus, ſince I ſpake againſt him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill:</hi> God doth ſurely hear all bemoaning penitent ſinners, and makes a book of remembrance. <hi>They which go forth weeping, ſowing precious ſeed, ſhall doubtleſs return with rejoycing, bringing their ſheaves with them.</hi> And then will you be called the repairers of breaches, and the reſtorers of Pathes to dwell in. I conclude all with the ſaying of one— <hi>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:66474:65"/>thereof in diſtreſſed conditions, are the two main things of this Verſe to be lookt into. The nature of friendſhip, is to love, — <hi>A friend loveth,</hi> &amp;c. Love is as much the formality of a friend, as rationality of a Man. Humane nature begets a kind of Kindred between all Man-kind, which ſtate ſuppoſeth love. — <hi>Cum natura quandam cognationem inter homines conſtituat, alterum alteri inſidiari nefas eſt,</hi> ſaith the Civilian. Whereas nature makes a certain Kindred between Men, for one to betray another, is moſt wicked. Now, if nature make a kind of Kindred, and ſo conſequently love, much more friendſhip makes a kind of Kindred, yea neer Kindred, <hi>a brother.</hi> A friend is, as my Text ſaith, <hi>a brother,</hi> as a very neer Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or as a neereſt Kinſman. And you may as well ſay <hi>a brother,</hi> is a brother with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out love, as ſay a friend is a friend without love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A friend loveth,</hi> &amp;c. that is, purely. Pure love is that which ſpringeth from pure Principles, which are two, love to GOD, and love to Man, as ſome way or other bearing his Image, either by Creation or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and ſo not upon any ſelf-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Thus <hi>David</hi> loved <hi>Saul,</hi> and was much pleaſed with the Men of <hi>Jabeſh Gilead</hi> that buried <hi>Saul,</hi> and much offended with the <hi>Amalechite</hi> that killed him, although he was his great and implacable Enemy. And
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:66474:65"/>thus <hi>Jonathan</hi> loved <hi>David,</hi> although <hi>David</hi> dethroned him. <hi>Jonathan was grieved that his Father had done David ſhame, ſo Jonathan aroſe from the Table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the ſecond day of the Moneth, for he was grieved for David, becauſe his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had done him ſhame,</hi> I Sam. 20.34. A friend loveth a friend upon his honour, as he would be found anſwering the will of God, and the Creatures true good, and for no bribe of applauſe or profit.</p>
               <p>The Men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were angry with the Men of <hi>Judah,</hi> for ſtealing <hi>David</hi> home from his exile without them. And the Men of <hi>Juda</hi> made this ingenuous reply. The King is neer of Kin to us, Wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? Have we eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en at all of the King's coſt? Or hath he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us any gift? 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.42. Have we (as if they had ſaid) any ſelf-end in our kindneſs to <hi>David,</hi> but ſhewing pure love, as ſuch a neer Relation requires.</p>
               <p>The love of ſympathy is pure love. The Iron moveth to the Load-ſtone, not from knowledge, conſequently not from deſign, but from ſome hidden ſimilitude in proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between them, which is as love in ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Creatures, and from the hand of the firſt mover, which inclines this Creature to that, as pleaſeth him; and no more elſe can
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:66474:66"/>be ſaid, of the matters of friendſhip, no gifts, nor this, nor that make it: <hi>We love not yours but you,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> A <hi>friend loveth,</hi> &amp;c. that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, not in word only, but in deed, as the Apoſtle ſaith. <hi>And David ſaid to Abiathar, I knew how it would be, when Doeg the Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite was there, I have occaſioned the death of all theſe Perſons of thy Fathers houſe, abide thou with me, fear not, for he that ſeeketh thy life, ſeeketh my life, but with me thou ſhalt be in ſafety,</hi> I <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.23. I will take care of thy life and livelihood, as of my own, as of he had ſaid. A friend is <hi>alter ego,</hi> another ſelf. <hi>Huſhai</hi> is called <hi>David</hi>'s friend, and he made <hi>David</hi>'s caſe and condition his own, and adventured himſelf far, as far as his life, and laid down his life for his friend.</p>
               <p>Beaſts love one another, and will fight for one another to the death, whoſe friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is but a love of ſympathy. There are in <hi>England</hi> 9725 Pariſhes, how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Souls may be in theſe Pariſhes? If I ſhould be asked by Men in Place, what is true friendſhip to all theſe Souls? I would anſwer, To love them really: What is that? I <hi>anſwer,</hi> To love them in words and in deeds, to do as he we read of, (in the Acts of the Apoſtles,) <hi>He loved our Nation, and built us a Synagogue,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide able and faithful Preachers for every
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:66474:66"/>Pariſh through theſe Kingdomes, that is, to love their Souls, and to feed them, and ſo to love their Bodies, who are in want, and to feed them, and to cloath them, my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſet good Miniſters and good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates over them, this were to love real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo to be a true friend to the Nation, and to all in it. To give titles of honour and complements, this is not that which fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth up the definition of friendſhip. Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not a City, and all Places ſtudy plaucibility of carriage, and muſt this by and by be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led friendſhip?</p>
               <p>But as <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſaid to <hi>Huſhai</hi> that ſtuck not to him in his diſtreſs, <hi>Is this thy kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to thy friend? to talk and to give goodly complements? Why wenteſt thou not-with thy friend?</hi> 2 Sam. 16.7. A poor Widdow, a Miniſters poor Widdow (of which there be many now) complained to the Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and he became a friend to her, what was that? <hi>Anſw.</hi> He loved her really. And <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaid to the Widdow of the Prophet. — <hi>What ſhall I do for thee?</hi> 2 Kings 4.2. and did do for her to purpoſe, as much as her condition needed. Set her out of debt, and gave her and hers wherewith to live upon. <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us of a Sea that doth, <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipere amnem in rotam ſed non recipit.</hi> That is, takes in ſuch a River, but doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturaliſe it ſelf with it, doth not incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it as with other waters, but as it goeth
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:66474:67"/>in, ſo it goes out: And juſt ſo do we open our Doors, and Gates of our Houſes and Towns, and <hi>accipere,</hi> take in poor Miniſters and poor People, but do not <hi>recipere,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, <hi>i. e.</hi> welcome in, with — <hi>What ſhall I do for you and for yours?</hi> and make their wants as our own, and mingle tears, and ſighs, and cares, and travels, and ſpirits, and purſes with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A <hi>friend loveth,</hi> &amp;c. that is, ſtrongly or unexpreſſibly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>I am diſtreſſed for thee my brother Jonathan, very pleaſant haſt thou been unto me, thy love to me was [won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful]</hi> paſſing the love of Women, 2 Sam. 1.26. <hi>Niphla</hi> from <hi>Pala,</hi> it ſignifies (ſaith the Critick) high and hidden, ſuch as Man's power cannot reach nor perform, nor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon attain unto. Uſed <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.16. <hi>For wherein ſhall it be known here, that I and thy People have found favour in thy ſight? Is it not in that thou goeſt with us? So ſhall we be ſeparated, I and thy People from all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are upon the Face of the Earth.</hi>— <hi>Separated,</hi> this is the word, that is, ſo ſhall we be a People above all expreſſion, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and beloved, and honoured, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So did <hi>Jonathan</hi> honour and eſteem <hi>David,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all expreſſion. And ſuch is the love of a friend it ſhould ſeem, as ſet forth to us by the Word.</p>
               <p>There is a Hauke which they call <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:66474:67"/>humipeta,</hi> becauſe it lies hovering over Mice and little Vermin on the Earth, and petty ſmall Birds, as they peep in Hedges and Furrowes, and uſeth not to ſoar and ſeek any noble and great Game, as ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of ſtately Hawkes do: So there is a love of Man to Man, attended with ſome ſmall realities of action, giving ſome ſmall Mony as one goeth the Streets, and broken meat from the Table, and ſuch like little low things, of kindneſſes and love, which may well be ſpared, and no prejudice; but this kind of love, though it hath a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in it, and doth good, and would there were more of this in theſe times, yet it doth not denominate the Perſon, which ſo doth a friend, according to the ſenſe of my Text, and yet he is a friend in a large ſenſe, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a little ſenſe.</p>
               <p>A friend is a Man of a noble Spirit, that ſoares high and far, to fetch the biggeſt and beſt prey, to feed and ſupply want. Hence it is that one compares friendſhip, to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; becauſe friendly love is ſtronger than that, which runs in any other Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel.</p>
               <p>Now how wonderful for ſtrength! and how unexpreſſable for pleaſure and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs! Is marriage love? as we have ſome ſignature of it through <hi>Solomon</hi>'s love-Song, where the word <hi>Friend</hi> is uſed, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Marriage-love, and the higheſt love
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:66474:68"/>which paſſeth between Man-kind. — <hi>His Mouth is moſt ſweet, yea he is altogether love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: This is my beloved, and this is my [friend] O Daughter of Jeruſalem,</hi> Cant. 5.16. And proportionable to ſuch a great love, is all induſtry and expence to help and bleſs with the beſt and moſt precious things. As <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunah</hi> brought friendſhips like a Prince to <hi>David,</hi> and yet but a friend and a ſtranger, a Gentile. And the wiſe Men of the Eaſt, what Preſents they made to <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> and their Child, or elſe they had had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to flee with all into <hi>Aegypt</hi> to ſave their lives. And our Saviour who was <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi>'s friend, how he ſighed and groaned to make a Reſurrection of Him, ſo that ſtanders by beholding his carriage, his ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his weeping over <hi>Lazarus</hi> Grave, ſaid, <hi>Behold how he loved him!</hi> which is written, that we might have a right pourtraiture of a friend, So <hi>Chriſt</hi> called <hi>Lazarus</hi> — <hi>Our friend Lazarus is dead.</hi> And <hi>Martha</hi> which was <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s friend, What a deal of care, and how taken up to provide all that poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble could be for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and thought ſhe could never provide what was good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
               <p>And ſo <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when he became a friend to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> he thought he could never do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for him, he ſet him up next to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, over all his own Nation and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And ſo the <hi>Perſian</hi> Emperor advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:66474:68"/>
                  <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Mordecai.</hi> A friend is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, and a favourite is a ſignet ſet on the heart, by the finger of God, than which, What is of more eſtcem?</p>
               <p>At ſuch a great and unexpreſſableneſs of love, as the true form of a friend, pointeth that Scripture, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.6. And obſerve well the words, at what a height a friend is put, even by the Lord himſelf, in ſome ſenſe it ſhould ſeem, above all relations. <hi>If thy brother, the Son of thy Mother, or thy Son or thy Daughter, or the Wife of thy boſome, or thy Friend, which is as thy own Soul;</hi> entice thee. The meaning of all theſe high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, is, that the love of a friend is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong, unexpreſſable, no relation, nor thing in this World, dear enough, nor full enough almoſt to expreſs it. A Brother, a Son, a Daughter, a Wife, yea ones own Soul; a Friend is as neer, as dear, as any of theſe, and being brought in in the cloſe, when he had named all neer Relations.— <hi>Or thy Friend which is as thine own Soul;</hi> he would ſeem to give preheminence of love to a friend, and ſet him, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> next indeed to his own Soul and Life. And if of due there go ſuch a deep Channel of love to the Creature, O! what an Ocean of love is due to <hi>Chriſt</hi> our good friend.</p>

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:66474:72"/>truly in great diſtreſſes, this is the Vinegar, Gall and Wormwood, which even Friends give, in ſtead of Cordials, in ſtead of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions, and pains, and expence to make relief. A great many ſevere enquiries.</p>
               <p>How did he come into ſuch want? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he is an ill husband, he did not follow his buſineſs: How did he come into all this trouble? Surely he was a buſie body, he medled with that which he needed not have done: His Wife and Children go too fine. A thouſand holes are pickt in the Man's Coat quickly; and the reaſon, becauſe ſo poor, and needeth ſome to help him, and none of theſe holes found in his coat whilſt it had a good nap upon it, as long as he had no need of friends. So that they that go for Friends are the worſt of Enemies, and afflict in ſtead of comfort, and more afflict than an Enemy would do.</p>
               <p>And yet alaſs this is commonly the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of this World, yea of ſuch too much whom God hath called out of this World, and off of this World; which is, as if one ſhould ſee a Man or Woman in the Field, and bleeding to death, and ſhould ſpend nis time in curious enquiries how it came, and who did it, and why would he go that way alone, and be out ſo late, and never do any thing to ſtay the Man's bleeding, or do any thing to ſave his life.</p>

               <p>Either it is thus, or elſe it is, <hi>I will ſhew kindneſs to Hanun, as his Father ſhew'd kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me,</hi> 2 Sam. 10.

               <p>A <hi>Samaritan</hi> is a rare Man, who though a ſtranger, and upon no account in the World, but as the wounded Man needed him, fell in with him unasked, and gave him a full relief, and what is more needed, put that upon my account, ſaid this ſtranger. And now, ſaith <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and friend? Such a Neighbour now, and Friend, I fear, is hard to be found.</p>
               <p>A Friend, ſaith <hi>Seneca,</hi> is not only rare in a Houſe, but in an Age. <hi>Aliter de amore atque eſt accipis,</hi> ſaith one.—Thou thinkeſt otherwiſe of love than it is; and ſo we think otherwiſe of friendſhip than it is; we think it a ſlight cheap cold buſineſs, and ſo think that the World is full of friends and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, till we come to want a Friend.</p>

               <p>Learn that the Providence of GOD is much to be reverenced, for he makes friends, and moſt an end of ſtrangers, and others fail us, on whom our expectation moſt is, that we may the more reverence GOD and his Providence.</p>

                  <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s Kindred failed him, and God raiſed up <hi>Ebedmelech,</hi> and <hi>Ahikam,</hi> and both at ſuch times, that ſurely <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe loſt his life: he had been ſtarved to death, had it not been for <hi>Ebedmelech.

                  <hi>David was a ſtranger to his Brethren, and an alien unto his Mothers Children,</hi> Pſal. 69.8.

               <p>For had we our reliefs ſtill, from ſuch as are ſome way engaged to be helpful, either as ſome way related, or as ſome way by our kindneſs to them obliged to us, it would make us take our eſcapes in danger, our ſupplies and helps in ſtraits, more ſlightly, and forgetfully.</p>
               <p>Courſe uſually are the kindneſſes of neer relations, ſometimes as Reeds they run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hands, and ſo far from being merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that they are unjuſt.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren to him, and God had a Soveraign hand in all that, that he might raiſe Brethren to <hi>Joſeph</hi> himſelf, yea that he might make <hi>Joſeph</hi> a better Brother in adverſity to them, than they had been to him.</p>
               <p>The laſt Uſe of this Point is for Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Do you become ſuch friends, Brethren, for this Day of Adverſity. Be pittiful, be kindly affectioned, be tender-hearted, be cloathed with humility and bowels, ſtoop and waſh the Saints Feet, yea to pull thine Enemies Oxe out of the Ditch, and to lift up his Beaſt, if fallen down under his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,

               <p>If ye be friends to friends, What ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar thing do ye? Be friends to ſtrangers, yea to the poor and friendleſs; ſuch as whoſe Perſons you do not know, only their caſes are well known; yea be friends to ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, yea though illy requited: So was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> ſo was, and ſo is <hi>Chriſt</hi> to Thouſands and Millions every Day, among which it may be you are ſome. <hi>They lacked not any thing,</hi> in the firſt Church of the Goſpel, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.34.

               <p>And if ye take the name of friend, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that you are created <hi>Brethren in the day of adverſity,</hi> and fulfill the Law of your adopted and choſen relation. Let not the diſtreſſed want, if you can help them; I cannot exhort you yet to ſell to be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but I would I could firſt exhort you to buy ſome thing here and there, that you might be ſubſtantial friends to many in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,

               <p>But one ſaith he will help, and he will be a friend, and he eats the fleſh; and another he ſaith, give him but a good Fee, and he will help, and he will be a friend, and he takes the poor Carcaſe that is beſt, and he picks the bones; and of theſe friends there are great ſtore, but few ſuch as my Text de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth, for which I fear the Land mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and much more will.</p>
               <p>Be friends to the diſtreſſed be ſo ſimply. <hi>Is there any of the Houſe of Saul, that I may ſhew the kindneſs of God to him,</hi> 2 Sam. 9.3. And <hi>Ziba</hi> that Wretch ſaid, <hi>Jonathan hath yet a Son that is lame of his Feet;</hi> and would not ſo much as give his Name, nor put the leaſt word of reſpect, as if he would have inſinuated to <hi>David,</hi> that this Criple was not worth the looking after, by ſuch a Man of honour as <hi>David.</hi> And ſuch ſelf-ſeeking Wretches, great Men have at their elbows, which keep them from becoming ſimple and ſincere friends. For ſimple friendſhip is to look after Criples, and beggers, blind, and lame, and halt, as Chriſt doth. To invite them to our Table, which have ſcarce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to eat at their own Table, who to be
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:66474:75"/>ſure cannot invite us again; and to be Legs to the lame, and Eyes to the blind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe are ſo unthankful, that who can have any heart to do any thing for them? <hi>I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi> Such whoſe hearts are ſimple, and who as <hi>David</hi> ſhew ſimple friendſhip, they will look upon Criples as Criples, and blind as blind, lame and blind in their Souls, as well as in their Bodies; and, if you would have People be thankful, be ſimple in your kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, let them ſee that you do not ſeek theirs in the leaſt but them, every way the relief of them. <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> was never like to make a Man of uſe to attend upon <hi>David,</hi> to honour his Table; this had been rather to have ſought a friendſhip, than to have ſhewed one. It is a Cuſtome amongſt the <hi>Turkes,</hi> not to believe a Chriſtian's, or a <hi>Jew</hi>'s complaint againſt a <hi>Turk,</hi> without a <hi>Turk</hi>'s witneſs too, and that is the reaſon, why in ſuch Caſes Juſtice is much corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo little to be had; I only allude to this: The caſes and conditions of many oppreſſed poor and mean ones is ſuch, that unleſs they can get ſuch and ſuch as are great to witneſs to their cauſe, and own them, and ſtick to them, their own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints will not be believed nor heard; not indeed will any take it in hand, unleſs they ſee that which may be good ſelf-encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and advantage; ſo that falleth out to be true, which that great Stateſman ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:66474:76"/>in his Days.—<hi>The rich have many friends,</hi> not only one friend, of which the poor would be glad, but <hi>many friends,</hi> and <hi>the Poor is hated of his own Neighbour,</hi> Prov. 14.20. And, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.4. <hi>Wealth maketh many friends, but the poor is ſeparated from his neighbour.</hi> When ye ſee a gold Ring on a Man's Finger, there you take him up, and his cauſe is good, as <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſaid, and ye do but want one well to plead it, and I will do it, and I will do it: and what a many friends the wealthy Man, and the Man with the Gold Ring, and long Hair hath! but a poor Man that hath but one Ewe Lamb, as <hi>Nathan</hi>'s Parables, is, but a little eſtate left, and that in danger to be all taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way too, who ſtrives to plead this Perſons caſe? and to own, and to cleave to ſuch a helpleſs one? Wherefore I exhort, be ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in your friendſhip, as purely born for adverſity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Be tender and ſtrong friends, that is, not in word only, but in deed, and in the greateſt actions, and labours, and deeds, which diſtreſſes need to relieve them. What a friend <hi>Barzillai</hi> was to <hi>David</hi> in his diſtreſs, againſt <hi>Abſalom</hi> beyond <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> How brought he him all Proviſions for Himſelf and Followers, which <hi>David</hi> much remembred, becauſe it was ſo ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And what a friend was <hi>Obadia</hi> to the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:66474:76"/>Lord's Prophets, when the violence of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi> and <hi>Jeſſabel</hi> was great, who hid them by Fifties in a Cave, when it muſt needs be with the peril of his life. And our Saviour ſeems to grant ſuch a ſtrength in friendſhip, as to lay down the life for a friend. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Greater love hath no Man than this, that a Man lay down his life for his friends.</hi> Our Saviour ſeems to grant ſuch a height in the love of friendſhip. And the Apoſtle ſaith, we ought to lay down our life for a brother. And a friend is a created Brother of our own Creation, and created of purpoſe for a plunge. Therefore it will be lovely, to get all the heights of true friendſhip in this evil Day, becauſe diſtreſſes and plunges are ſo high, and hard, and great. Nothing leſs almoſt will relieve ſome poor diſtreſſed People, unleſs we do much expoſe our ſelves as <hi>Obadia,</hi> and the Brethren which reſcued <hi>Paul</hi> out of the Tumult, when he was knockt down, and all thought he was dead. <hi>And Rizpah the Daughter of Aiah took Sack-cloth, and ſpread it for her upon the Rock, from the begining of Harveſt till Water drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon them, and ſuffered neither the Birds of the Air to reſt on them, by Day, nor the Beaſts of the Field by Night,</hi> 2 Sam. 21.10. <hi>Rizpah</hi> made a covering over her of this Sack-cloth, and ſate under it day and night, with thoſe dead Corpſes of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Family, which friendſhip was very ſtrong, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:66474:77"/>and painful, and <hi>David</hi> took it won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful well at her hands. And if ſhe did ſo watch with the dead, that no violence might be done by Birds, or Beaſts;<note place="margin">It was strong friendſhip in him, which ſaid come and let us go and die with him.</note> 'Twere well if we could watch with the living, and that we could play the friends ſo, to many in Priſons, and bonds, and extremities, which are not dead Corpſe yet, but almoſt ſo, and many of them worſe than ſo, that is, worſe than if they were dead; my meaning is, that where diſtreſs is great, we would become great friends.—Our Rule is to <hi>covet the beſt gifts,</hi> to be moſt eminent and excellent in every Grace, and be you in this, of friendſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Be thus always: And <hi>Hyram</hi> King of <hi>Tyre</hi> ſent his Servants unto <hi>Solomon</hi> for he had heard that they had anointed Him King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for <hi>Hiram was ever a lover of David.</hi> 1 Kings 5.1. This is the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty made of friendſhip in my Text—<hi>A friend loveth at all times.</hi> Had <hi>Hiram</hi> been a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>David</hi> only ſometimes, and when <hi>David</hi> had no need of him, doubtleſs <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> would have been cautious of him, and not have put him among the number of his friends; but; <hi>he was always a lover of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid. And it fell on a day, that Eliſha paſſed to Shunem, where was a great Woman, and ſhe conſtrained him to eat Bread. And ſo it was that as oft as he paſſed by, he returned in thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:66474:77"/>to eat bread.</hi> Not once or twice coldly invited, but ſhe conſtrained him, and as oft as he paſſed by, and that ſhe might be ſure of him always when he went that way,— <hi>She ſaid to her Husband, behold now, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that this is an holy Man of God, which paſſeth by us continually, let us make a little Chamber in the Wall, and let us ſet for him there a Bed, a Table, a Stool, and a Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, and it ſhall be when he cometh to us, that he turn in thither,</hi> 2 Kings 4.10. Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is a natural thing, and what is natural is durable. I have none that doth <hi>ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally care for me,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Timothy.</hi> A friend becomes a Brother.— that is, naturally affected; as if fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone, and 'tis ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in nature, that natural relations are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural always; as hand, and the foot to the head, and the head to the hand and foot are tenderly and ſtrongly careful and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate always. <hi>Jonathan went to David in the Cave, and ſtrengthned his hand in God,</hi> as well as when <hi>David</hi> was in favour with <hi>Saul;</hi> and that their friendſhip might be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting, how ſolemnly they ſwore one to another, that their friendſhip might run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long from Generation to Generation, and yet <hi>Jonathan</hi> was a Brother to <hi>David</hi> by marriage, and yet he rather choſe to ſtick and truſt to the bond of ſolemn friendſhip, a Brother as made ſo, by becoming a friend.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:66474:78"/>
               <p>Now for Motives to preſs you, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch friends: <hi>Firſt,</hi> This may be ſaid; God looks for it. <hi>I was an hungry, and ye gave me no meat, I was thirſty and ye gave me no drink, I was a ſtranger and ye took me not in, naked and ye cloathed me not,</hi> Mat. 25.43. I was a ſtranger and needed a friend, and could finde none; This complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Nabals</hi> at the great Day, ſheweth that GOD much expecteth this, that we ſhould be friends to ſuch as are in diſtreſs, and have no help, nor cannot help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>Thou ſhalt neither vex a ſtranger nor oppreſs him; for ye were ſtrangers in the Land of Aegypt; ye ſhall not afflict Widows or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs Children. If thou afflict them in any wiſe, and they cry at all to me, I will ſurely hear their cry, and my wrath ſhall wax hot, and I will kill you with the Sword, and your Wives ſhall be Widows, and your Children Fatherleſs,</hi> Exod. 22.21, 22, 23, 24. The reaſon why the Lord would not have ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, nor Widows and Fatherleſs abuſed, and that he will take it ſo ill at our hands to do it, is, becauſe theſe uſually are friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and have none to help them, whereas he expecteth therefore that we ſhould (and ought to) be friends, and help theſe, and not do as all do, or as the moſt do abuſe them, or at leaſt not look after them. By which it is manifeſt, that God looks that we ſhould be friends to our friendleſs, 'tis their
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:66474:78"/>due, and therefore the friendleſs may look for it too, as well as God. <hi>With hold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it,</hi> Prov. 3.27.</p>
               <p>Many need friends in this day, therefore become friendly. <hi>And when Abſalom's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants came to the Woman to the Houſe, they ſaid, Where is Ahimaas and Jonathan? And ſhe ſaid, they be gone over the Brook of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And when they had ſought and could not finde them, they returned to Jeruſalem. And it came to paſs after they were departed, that they came up out of the Well, and went and told King David, and ſaid ariſe, and paſs quickly over the Water, for thus hath Ahito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel counſelled againſt you,</hi> 2 Sam. 17.20, 21. Many of the Lord's People in theſe evil Days, need friends to hide them, the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian World is ſo full of Achitophels purſuing of them; be therefore as this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, friends, with your Houſes, with your Eſtates, with your Intereſts. The Diſciples let down <hi>Paul</hi> at a Window in a Basket: Alaſs, ah, and alaſs! the ſtraits which many have been put to in this day, and how many may yet be, who knows then how much it is needed, that you become friends to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed. For many of us Miniſters, it may be ſaid of us, as <hi>Livy. Paſtor accola ejus loci,</hi> a Paſtor that dwells, hard by that Place.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:66474:79"/>And ſo we are Paſtors, which live by our Places, ſome of us, or rather indeed die by them, but cannot live in them; and more then many can do that, <hi>To live by their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> but muſt hide their heads one while, and wander here and there another while, to get Bread for them and theirs, and well when they ſeek it, if they can finde it. And not a few Miniſters and others in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, how many then need friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Conſider the great ſervice that you may do for God, and for his People, this way. <hi>And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harveſt time, unto the Cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philiſtines pitched in the Valley of Repha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im. And David was then in an hold, and the Gariſon of the Philiſtines was then in Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem.</hi> 2 Sam. 23.13. And <hi>Adullam</hi> was but a little from thence, and yet <hi>David</hi>'s three Worthies came to him, and relieved him in the face of them all, Troop and Gariſon of the Philiſtines, and ſo did him the ſervice of Threeſcore, or Three-Hundred Men.

Whilst he was yet ſpeaking there came another, and ſaith, the Fire of God is fallen from Heaven,</hi> i. e. <hi>A great Fire, and hath burnt up the Sheep, and the Servants, and I only am eſcaped to tell thee.</hi> Poor <hi>Job</hi> now indeed, that Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, from the Lord out of Heaven, ſhould be rained upon him, as upon <hi>Sidom,</hi> that ſo he might judg himſelf to deſerve, no better than the wicked <hi>Sodomites</hi> did; What a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of high Trial, and what a great Twig in the Rod was this? Yea, God ſaith of the Devil, that he <hi>moved him againſt Job, without cauſe, to ſwallow him up,</hi> Job 2.3. that is, ſaith the Margent, when the Devil had nought againſt him, nor able to bring his own malicious deſigns to paſs againſt him; yet read Satans Second Commiſſion; <hi>So went Satan forth from the preſence of the Lord, and ſmote Job with ſore boils from the ſole of his Foot, to the crown of his Head, and he took him a potſherd to ſcrape himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:66474:87"/>and ſate down amongſt the aſhes; and then his friends poured Gall and Vinegar into his Cup: which altogether made his afflictions of the greateſt magnitude indeed, the greateſt. I think, that ever meer Man had. <hi>David</hi> tells us of the Lyon, and the young Lyon upon him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.12. and of ſuch as did ſet their mouths againſt the Heavens, and bark and bite all good Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and things, and therefore the Lord's People returned <hi>hither,</hi> that is, when they could get no ſhelter from the wicked, <hi>and Waters of a full Cup were wrung out to them,</hi> Pſal 73.10. And full Cups of miſery, ſpeak the greateſt puniſhments for degree and quantity.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> God brings afflictions upon Men, yea upon the beſt Men, as great and ſharp, ſo of long continuance. It hath been a ſharp Winter this, and of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; ſo doth God make in other matters, ſome times. Some Rivers<note n="*" place="margin">As <hi>Nilus</hi> that anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent River.</note> had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with the World, and ſo it may be will have their end, not till the World ends. And ſome afflictions have their beginning as ſoon as we, and will have no end till we have; yea, ſome Rods extraordinary begin with ſome good People, as ſoon almoſt as they begin to be, and end not till they end their lives. It is God's threat, that if all his Laws be not obſerved, and his glorious and fearful Name.—<hi>The Lord thy God,</hi> be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:66474:87"/>and reverenced, (And, who can call God his God, but God's Children?) that then he will inflict upon his People great Plagues and of <hi>long continuance, and ſuch he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,</hi> and ſuch he hath ſaid in the new Teſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament alſo, will fall out, great troubles, and of long continuance, ſo long, as if he heard no Prayers, that every ones faith and patience ſhall faint and fail. When the Son of Man ſhall come, ſhall he finde ſaith upon the Earth? <hi>Like a Crane or a Swallow, ſo did I chatter, I did mourn as a Dove,</hi> that is, always, ſo the next words expound it, — <hi>Mine eyes fail with looking upward,</hi> GOD gave no anſwer, that his faith was quite ſpent; <hi>O Lord I am oppreſſed,</hi> and bear all the burden alone, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertake for me,</hi> lend me a hand. <hi>What ſhall I ſay, he hath ſpoken unto me, and himſelf hath done it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> it will never be undone, <hi>I ſhall go ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all my Years in the bitterneſs of my ſoul,</hi> Iſa. 38.14, 15. That God inflicts puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, great puniſhments, and of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance upon good People, read 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.27. <hi>And the King of Iſrael ſaid, put this fellow in the Priſon, and feed him with the bread of affliction, and the water of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, until I come in peace.</hi> His warrant (you ſee) had a long date. Thus God ſometime let looſe wicked Men upon the beſt of his, to faſten their teeth, and ſcarce ever let go their hold, till they have pluckt out their
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:66474:88"/>throats; to lay them faſt in all extremities, like <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and there let them lie long till even their skin and bones rot. And as God lets Men deal thus with their body; ſo he lets the Devil ſometimes deal thus with their Soul, worry them, and worrry them long, even all their days. 'Tis but GOD's Commiſſion given to the Devil, and he will do it; as 'tis God's Commiſſion given to wicked Men to torment, and then they do it, and without his Commiſſion, a Dog could not bark or ſhew his teeth againſt any child of God. <hi>The Plowers plowed upon my back, and they made long their Furrows,</hi> Pſal. 129.3. <hi>And woe is me that I remain in Meſhech, and dwell in the Tents of Kedar, my ſoul hath too long dwelt with him that hateth peace,</hi> Pſal. 120.5, 6. God excommunicated <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezar</hi> Seven Years, and made him a Companion for Beaſts; and ſo ſometimes he excommunicates his own People, and makes them companions (as <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi> with Black mores) with Devils, thoſe black Fiends of the loweſt Hell, and ſo long.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons of this Point are theſe: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That God may ſhew his Soveraignty, I will not ſay h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Juſtice. We have all ſin'd, even the beſt Men, and therefore God may bring all afflictions and miſeries upon the beſt. But I rather chooſe to ſay, that God may ſhew what an abſolute Lord of all He
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:66474:88"/>is, and can ſet up what Man he will to be his mark to ſhoot at, and then take him down, and ſet up another. <hi>Mine iniquities are more than the hairs of my head, ſaith Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 40.12. Uſually leſs than this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber are our afflictions when moſt, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where God ſhews ſoveraignty, he alſo ſheweth juſtice. <hi>Iſrael would none of me,</hi> Pſal. 81.11. Therefore where God pronounced to <hi>Ammi,</hi> I will have none of this People, he was juſt as well as abſolute, and perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory in his will. Sometimes God ſmites a ſinner, as <hi>Joab</hi> ſmote <hi>Amaſia</hi> under the fiſt Rib, ſo as that he ſmites him not again, maketh an utter end at a blow, and no cauſe viſible no more than in other of the Sons and Daughters of Men, and of his People: This properly we call ſoveraignty: Thus may be ſmite any one: for we have not (any one of us all) the priviledge of <hi>Antwarp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> who have two marts laſting ſix weeks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, during which time no Man in his Perſon or Goods can be arreſted. No man hath ſuch priviledge for a day, in order to God: he can arreſt Perſon, Goods, and Life when he pleaſeth, and yet in all ſo, that none can charge him with injuſtice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Doth thus, bring all afflictions upon Men, yea upon the beſt Men, to try in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity. The Sea pulleth up from its bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom all excrements, as well in fair weather as in fowl, ſaith <hi>Seneca;</hi> but ſo doth not the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:66474:89"/>Soul. Thou haſt made a Hedge about <hi>Job,</hi> Doth he ſerve thee for naught? No, thou doſt give him much, and ſo hire him to ſerve thee, do but take away as thou haſt given to him, and he will curſe thee to thy face, ſo ſaith God, all he hath is in thine hands, and then again ſaith, touch his Bone and his Fleſh, and he will curſe thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Eſtate, and take away health, health and wealth, and then queſtionleſs he will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake ſuch a hard Maſter: and yet Satan was deceived, <hi>Job</hi> held his integrity, and now <hi>Job</hi> goes for current Coin in the Lords ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Haſt thou conſidered my Servant <hi>Job, that he is a juſt Man and upright,</hi> &amp;c. Though thou haſt moved me againſt him without cauſe, ſuch an inſtance is <hi>David.</hi> — Thou didſt thruſt ſore at me (that is) Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, becauſe he ſaith, that he thruſt ſore at him, <hi>that he might fall,</hi> but the Lord helped me, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.13. God afflicts ſore ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and then the Devil thruſts ſore, to ſhipwrack Conſcience ſome way or other, and thus doth God try Men ſometimes, to know all that is in their heart. There is a Nurſery at a great Dukes ſeat abroad, which is called <hi>Schola illuſtris.</hi> Great afflictions are the great God's <hi>Schola illuſtris,</hi> that in and by which, he makes the integrity of Men appear, that is, all the graces of Men in their true glory. — According to that, 1 Pet. 1.7. <hi>That the trial of your faith being
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:66474:89"/>much more precious, than that of Gold that periſheth may be found unto praiſe and honour at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Barbils ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken among Rocks are brave Fiſh, and have their right colour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God brings all afflictions on Men, yea on good Men, to humble and to mortify. Our Fathers were worried with all afflictions in the Wilderneſs forty Years together, as to prove them, ſo to humble them, to pull down pride and ſtubborneſs, and to make them long much for <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land of Reſt. And <hi>Job</hi> was kept at ſuch a diſtance in all his conflicts as to try him, ſo to humble him and abaſe him, for his heart was too high, What good Man's heart is not? The Sacrifices of God are a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and a contrite ſpirit, ſuch ſacrifices in Religion God likes well, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17. He doth not deſpiſe low, humble, bleeding ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that is, he doth not worry and ſleight to ſee them, becauſe they are as Wheat ground ſmall enough to be Bread fit for their Maſters Table. <hi>David,</hi> when his bones were all broken, that is, ſoul and body much afflicted, then he begins to talk of a broken ſpirit; when our conditions are high, our ſpirits are ſo too: and to bring the one low, the Lord is forſt to bring the other low too. <hi>Paul</hi> that was a high confident Man, God was fain from Heaven to fell him to the Earth, and afterward to keep him low and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:66474:90"/>humble, was fain to let looſe corruptions of nature, and buffitings of Satan, that by theſe thornes in his ſides he might prick out and let out all the ſwelling windy conceits of himſelf, and of his own holineſs, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and uſefulneſs, which fluttered in his heart.—<hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> being a Criple, how humbly he ſpeaks! — And he bowed himſelf and ſaid, <hi>What is thy Servant that thou ſhouldſt look upon ſuch a dead Dog as I am,</hi> 2 Sam. 9.8. So when God Criples us in all things, wherein we may be of uſe to him, eſtate, health inward and outward, and yet keeps on a ſecret ſupport and kindneſs though not ſenſible, Oh how humble it makes the Man! What a dead Dog am I, that the Lord ſhould regard me to do the leaſt favour for me! the ground is too good to bear me. <hi>Naturali praevalet accidentale.</hi> Sometimes accidental things prevail againſt natural; accidental rods and puniſhments, prevail againſt Natural Corruptions and Sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As God doth bring all afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to mortify pride, ſo to mortify other ſins, to which our natures are too too prone, to pluck up all ſin by the roots well, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially hypocriſie, with which we do beſt play with, in the matter of humiliation and mortification, and renewing faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, till the Lord ſwinge us indeed with all his Rods, and long. <hi>David,</hi> though
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:66474:90"/>a good Man, was beaten till he roared, and made to roar all the Day long, and Night and Day was God's hand heavy on him, and his moiſture turned into the drought of Summer, to make him acknowledg and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs ſome ſpecial ſin, which lay hid and was kept cloſe, till a Fire was kindled in his bones, then he confeſſed, and ſpit out the ſweet morſel which he tumbled in his mouth ſo long, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.5. In ſome bad matters, we are very bad and naught, and ready to make excuſes and defences, and to hide our ſin this way, as <hi>Adam,</hi> 'tis but a little one, and I do not uſe it, it is but now and then, when I meet with ſuch bad company. All afflictions and ſmart Rods are but few e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in theſe caſes to make us ſpeak out, and do out as we ſhould, and to make ſuch clearing our ſelves in theſe bad matters as becometh Penitents. Sometimes of the year in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> when moſt hot, their Silver wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Lead, and no cover of any rich matter can endure ſaith the Hiſtorian; And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I may more fitly ſpiritualiſe it; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when the entiſements of ſome ſins moſt ſutable to our nature are ſtrong and hot through Satan's Fire-Darts, all our ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver becomes lead, (1) All our graces. Faith and love, and courage fails, and become cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and bribed by the ſin which ſo eaſily beſets; and then is God enraged, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about him as a jealous God, and taken
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:66474:91"/>up all his Rods, and layeth them on, as with all his might, and all little enough, to kill pleaſing ſin and beloved ſin at the Root, to diſ-heart it well. He makes a great Fire, to purify well, and make the ſcum come all out as it ſhould. When the Children of <hi>Ammon</hi> ſaw, that they ſtank before <hi>David,</hi> then they ſent to him the <hi>Syrians,</hi> 2 Sam. 10.6. So, till a Sinner by the many puniſhments of God, ſeeth that he ſtinks in the Noſtrils of God, he doth not raiſe forces againſt his ſin as he ſhould, (1) He doth not ſet hmſelf to repent of it, and clear and cleanſe his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions throughly of it, as he ſhould, by faith in the death of Chriſt. They ſay of the Spaw Waters broad, that they are not ſo pleaſant as wholeſome; ſo I may ſay of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, that they are not ſo pleaſant as wholeſome. <hi>Inutile per inutile perimitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As God brings afflictions upon Men, yea upon good Men, to mortify ſin well! ſo to mortify them well to all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural good things of this World, and ſo to make them indeed dead with Chriſt to all here. As the Nurſe puts bitter things on her breaſts, to take off the Child from the ſweet milk, and put his mouth out of reliſh, and no other way to do it: ſo doth God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter our conditions in this World, that ſo all the ſweets which we have here, we may uſe them as if we did not, and poſſeſs them, and they not poſſeſs us and our hearts. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:66474:91"/>had many bitten upon his condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could ſay, I have behaved my ſelf as a weaned Child. When the World was firſt crucified to <hi>Paul,</hi> then at length he became crucified to the World; when God whips us in this, and whips us in that; takes away this, and takes away that, then by degrees he takes away our hearts too, and ſets them upon better things, but uſually good things firſt die from us, before we become ſo good as to die from them. There is no labourer in <hi>Egypt</hi> that lifts up his eyes to Heaven; they are almoſt angry with the Sun, it doth ſo ſcorch them: Few labourers in and after this World, do lift up their eyes to Heaven much, whilſt the Sun-ſhine of proſperity is hot upon them, but rather angry and vexed, and cumbred with one thing or other, that the World doth not tumble in faſt enough. Few in health and wealth are heavenly.— In thoſe days was <hi>Hezekia</hi> ſick unto death, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.1. In thoſe days; When was that? ſee the Chapter foregoing. Aſſoon as he had obtain'd that great deliverance from the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> by Prayer, and all quiet, now leaſt he ſhould grow as <hi>David,</hi> when his War was ended, ſenſual and wanton, God ſmites him with the Plague, and bids him ſet his houſe in order, for he muſt die. <hi>David</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hunted up and down as a Partridge, and poured from Veſſel to Veſſel, what a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Man is he; and when this is over,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:66474:92"/>what a carnal Man is he! I am toſſed to and fro, as the Locuſt; mark what follows, <hi>My Knees are weak through faſting, Pſal.</hi> 109.23. When we are toſſed much, then we faſt and pray, and go to Heaven much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Knees. We read in Hiſtory of an Emperor ſtrangled putting on his Royal Robes; nothing more choak the ſeeds of Grace and Heavenly life, than the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this World; and therefore uſually, one way or other, God kills all things here, to kill us throughly to all here. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle bids us endure hardneſs as good Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. In hard ſtates and conditions grace beſt thrives, and the moſt noble things and ſouls to be found.</p>

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:66474:102"/>quiet in the midſt of this great tempeſt, as you may ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3 5, 6. which was Penn'd upon that occaſion. <hi>I laid me down and ſlept, I awakened for thou Lord ſustainedſt me, I will not be afraid of ten thouſands of People, that have ſet themſelves againſt me round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. Ariſe O God and ſave me, for thou haſt ſmitten all mine enemies upon the Cheek bone, thou haſt broken the teeth of the ungodly.</hi> By which it is evident that he ſaw the ruine of that great Army, and his own ſafety in the midſt of all that danger, and this by faith. The Waters of the Flood abated but one Cubit in Four Days when they began to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and yet <hi>Noah</hi> by faith knew he ſhould ſee them quite down at length, though long firſt. And ſurely through his faith theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haſted away to their proper places, for in the laſt day they abated eleven Cubits, which abated but one in four Days before; By this which hath been ſaid, we ſee, that Faith looketh through matters temporal, though never ſo dark and difficult.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Faith looketh through matters ſpiritual, though never ſo dark and difficult. As the power of natural corruption, the ſenſe of God's wrath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Faith can look through the power of natural corruption, than which what is a greater Mountain, in the eye of an enlighten'd Soul? <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God through Jeſus
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:66474:103"/>Chriſt our Lord, Rom.</hi> 7.24, 25. Faith hath a ſtrong and clear eye that can look through ſuch a big and black Mountain, as the body of death is. Satan and corrupt nature are called <hi>the ſtrong man and his goods, Mat.</hi> 12.29. and Chriſt ſpoils them both, and this faith ſeeth, when both natural corruption and Satan are at ſtrongeſt. <hi>But I ſee another Law in my members, willing againſt the Law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the Law of ſin, which is in my members. O wretched man, what a wretched ſtate am I in.</hi> And who can, or who will deliver me out of this ſlavery? and faith anſwers this hard queſtion. I thank God, Chriſt can and will, he that is mighty to ſave, on whom help for me is laid. To this may properly be added, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Likewiſe reckon ye your ſelves alſo to be dead indeed to ſin, but alive unto God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Faith doth reckon the body of fin dead, and all the Powers of it, becauſe that is done by Chriſt's death to procure it, a Cure that never failed. What ſhall we then ſay? if God be for us, who can be againſt us, or what can be againſt us. But God be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ye were the ſervants of fin, but now ye have obeyed from the heart the forme of Doctrin, into which ye were delivered. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my Mother warm me; behold, thou deſireſt truth in the inward parts, and in that inward
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:66474:103"/>hidden part thou ſhalt make me to underſtand wiſdome,</hi> that is, experience the power of grace, for by wiſdom is meant grace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51 5.6. By wiſdom is meant grace, and by knowing of wiſdom, means, experiencing of grace. Which ſheweth to us, that he by faith ſaw thorow the power of natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and all the grieving operations and prevalencies of it; and that the ſtate of his inward man which was ſo ungracious and which had ſo deceived him, and betrayed him in that matter of <hi>

Hence it is likewiſe that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the work of Mortification as done, which yet is ſtill but a doing as long as we are on this ſide Heaven, as ſeeing by faith, every accurſed thing in his heart ſlain. <hi>They that are Chriſt's have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts.</hi> That is certainly they ſhall. <hi>The Beaſts of the Field ſhall honor me, the Dragons and Owles, becauſe I give this and that in the Wilde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That is, Creatures by Nature as blind as Owles, and yet as confident and fiery as Dragons, theſe ſhall ſee and become as tame that a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Child may lead them. <hi>Jacob</hi> bleſſed <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben</hi> that went up to his Fathers Bed, and <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levy</hi> which had been ſuch Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in evil, and this he did by faith, ſaith the Author to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> which ſheweth
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:66474:104"/>that he ſaw thorow thoſe corruptions, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were over-taken, the one with lightneſs, the other with paſſion and fury, and that God would change all their hearts, both of the one and of the other and make them gracious; and doubtleſs in his light the Children come at length to ſee light, and by his faith were helped to believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Faith looketh thorow the ſenſe of God's wrath, which is he darkeſt and moſt dreadful thing or all. Chriſt did ſo, and he did it by faith, when he cryed, <hi>My God, my God. &amp;c. David</hi>'s ſin in the matter of <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> as much clouded his Soul as any thing and filled his ſoul with the ſenſe of Gods diſpleaſure, and yet he ſaw thorow that dark Cloud by faith, as you may ſee, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.23. <hi>But now he is dead, wherefore ſhould I faſt? Can I bring him back again? I ſhall go to him but he ſhall not return to me.</hi> By faith he ſaw God reconciled as to this foul buſineſs yea reconciled to the Childe that was ſmitten dead, or elſe he would not have wiped his eyes, and have ſaid, I ſhall go to him, but would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued weeping and after, the death of the Child moſt of all, as he did for <hi>Abſalom,</hi> whom he gave up for a caſtaway.

The People of God were very low at this time, even as in their Graves and Tombes, and yet there is the figure of Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance even on their Graves, they ſaw peace, when there was nothing but War. <hi>Who will bring me into the ſtrong City, Who will bring me into Edom?

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Faith looks thorow matters Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, as well as Perſonal, though never ſo dark and difficult. <hi>Thou will ſave the aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

For thou wilt ſave the afflicted People, but wilt bring down high looks. <hi>They that ſeek my Soul to deſtroy it, ſhall go into the lowest parts of the Earth, they ſhall fall by the Sword, they ſhall be a portion for Foxes; but the King ſhall rejoyce in God, every one that ſweareth by him ſhall glory, but the mouth of them that speak lies ſhall be ſtopped,</hi> Pſal. 63.10, 11. <hi>Noah</hi> came out of the Ark about <hi>November,</hi> the very beginning of Winter, when nothing was to be had, but what he had in the Ark for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and to begin the World withall; and yet he lookt thorow this great ſtrait, which reſpected not a Nation, but the whole world, and ſacrificed at the beginning of the new world, as <hi>Adam</hi> did at the beginning of the old, and ſo did caſt all his care on Chriſt, who well cared for him, and for all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in his hand, which reſpected the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting of this World.</p>
               <p>If you ask me how a believer doth make ſuch proſpect and perſpect? I anſwer, by theſe four things. <hi>First,</hi> By the Promiſe. The beſt Mens eyes fail in dark days, and it is well they do ſo, for then he betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:66474:105"/>to the promiſe, and by this Trunk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds afar off. A fooliſh or weak action fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Actione inepta ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbens; recurrit ad aptam.</note> maketh way to an action that is valid. A believers own ſight failing, maketh him to have recourſe to the promiſe, and by this he maketh proſpect through all. The Title of the Fifth <hi>Pſalm</hi> tells us, that it was made when the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> took <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Gath,</hi> mine Enemies would daily ſwallow me up, for they be many that fight againſt me; but how did he look through this Cloud? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, by the promiſe, as you may ſee, Verſe the 6. <hi>In God I will praiſe his word, in God I will put my truſt, I will not fear what Man can do, thou telleſt my wanderings, put thou my tears in thy Bottel. In God I will praiſe his word,</hi> verſ. 10. This word which he ſo much ſpeaks of, was that which we read, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. By which he lookt through ſin and death. <hi>Theſe be the laſt words of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, although my Houſe be not ſo with God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>et he hath made with me an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ordered in all things and ſure, for this is all my ſalvation, &amp;c.</hi> that is, inward and outward, temporal and ſpiritual. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is ſo ordered and made in all things, that in all matters whatſoever faith may ſee by it thorow and thorow; be it ſin of what kind ſoever. Such ſins as <hi>David</hi> committed, before or after converſion; or be it puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpiritual or corporal, deſertion of Soul, ſickneſs of body, diſtraction and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:66474:106"/>in the affairs of this World; bad Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, bad Kingdom, as never any Man could have greater plunges of all ſorts than he, and yet by this promiſe ſo ordered in all things, he ſaw ſtill thorow all. To the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is added the Seal and Oath, to make a ſtrong and clear ſight in the darkeſt caſe; And this alſo <hi>David</hi> made uſe of, when he fought with <hi>Aram Naharaim,</hi> and <hi>Aram Zoba,</hi> Pſal. 60.6. <hi>God hath ſpoken in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, I will rejoyce, I will divide Sechem, and mete out the valley of Succeth, Who ſhall bring me into Edom, wilt not thou which haſt caſt us off?</hi> God hath ſpoken in his holineſs or by his holineſs, that is, hath engaged himſelf by oath, and ſurely he will not break his word, and his oath. The Church like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe makech uſe of this Medium, to ſee clearly and ſtrongly through trials, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.35. My Covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my mouth, once have I ſworn by my holineſs, <hi>that I will not lie unto David.</hi> And in what a dark caſe the People of God were then, we may ſee by the following words, — <hi>But thou haſt caſt us off, and abhorred, thou haſt made void the Covenant of thy Servant,</hi> (this is the Prayer of the Church, urging the Covenant and Oath to <hi>David</hi>) <hi>Thou haſt broken down all his hedges, all that paſs by ſpoil him; thou haſt made his glory to ceaſe, and caſt his Throne down to the ground, Pſal.</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:66474:106"/>89.44: Thus did the Church look thorow their dark condition, by the Promiſe and Oath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> By Chriſt doth a believer look through all difficulties of what kind ſoever, inward or outward. <hi>The Lord ſaid to my Lord, ſit thou at my right hand, till I make thine Enemies thy Foot ſtool.</hi> What enemies? <hi>Anſ.</hi> All Enemies, inward and outward. The Pſalmiſt by vertue of Chriſt ſaw natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral corruption, guilt of ſin, and all Men and Devils oppoſing, deſtroyed. By the death of Chriſt, he ſaw guilt in all the Elect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; he ſhall drink of the brook in the way, that is, the black Book <hi>Kedron,</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he ſhould undergo a curſed death, and ſo ſatisfie the juſtice of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Perſon of all the Elect, lift up his head. Likewiſe by the life, interceſſion, and miniſtry of Chriſt he ſaw all corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of nature deſtroyed in the Elect. <hi>Thy People ſhall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holineſs,</hi> that is, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of thy holy Ordinances, <hi>Thou haſt the dew of thy youth,</hi> to ſupply them and to moiſten them. Likewiſe by the death of Chriſt he ſaw all outward enemies vain and Devils deſtroyed. <hi>The Lord at thy right hand ſhall ſmite through Kings in the day of his wrath, he ſhall judg among the Heathen, he ſhall fill the places with the dead Bodies, he ſhall wound the heads over many Countrys,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:66474:107"/>Pſal.</hi> 110. Many things have their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not according to their nature, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their skill and humility, ſaith <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca;</hi> ſo a believer hath his greatneſs and honour, not according to his nature and birth from Men, but according to ſuch a skill which God hath given to him, to make uſe of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to renounce ſtill all in himſelf, and by vertue of this he is very great and mighty, and able to do all things. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſo can ſee through all things by him. 'Twas through Chriſt that the Church ſaw through that dark ſtate before mentioned, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87. When all that paſſed by ſpoiled, and all hedges down, <hi>Then thou ſpakeſt in a Viſion, to thine holy one, and ſaidſt I have laid help upon one that is mighty, I have exalted one choſen out of the People, with whom mine Hand ſhall be eſtabliſhed, mine Arme ſhall ſtrengthen him, the enemy ſhall not exact upon him, nor the Sons of wickedneſs afflict him, and I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him:</hi> which though true of <hi>David,</hi> yet ſpecially and principally of Chriſt, and him did the Church then ſee in <hi>David,</hi> as he by whom all their enemies inward and outward ſhould be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By experiences doth a believer look through all difficulties and miſeries, Faith can help it ſelf by reaſon. <hi>What Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if his Child want bread,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> 
                  <hi>will give him a
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:66474:107"/>ſtone?</hi> This is reaſon. But much more can faith help it ſelf by experience. <hi>I am a man in authority, and I ſay to one man go and he goeth, and I ſay to another come and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, &amp;c.</hi> This is experience, and faith is wonderful weak indeed, when it cannot thus help up it ſelf, experiences are ſuch ſenſible and ſuch impreſſive things upon all powers within and without. <hi>O ye of little faith, do ye not remember the five loaves, and how many Baskets ye took up,</hi> Mat. 16. Chriſt takes it for granted that faith is very little and very weak indeed, when it cannot help it ſelf by experiences, things which the Man hath had done for him in his wants. He delivered me from the Lyon and the Bear, and he will deliver me from this uncircumciſed Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtim. <hi>The Lord, even Jeſus who appeared to thee in the way, he hath ſent that thou mighteſt receive thy ſight, and be filled with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Act. 9.17. Doubtleſs that experience which he had of ſuch an eſcape going to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> advantaged his faith all his days, to look thorow, and to run thorow all the ſtorms and perils which afterward he met withall. Some great ſickneſs the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had, by the ill uſage of Men who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed him, and yet God preſerved, and how he raiſed faith by experience to look thorow all evils preſent, and to come, ſee 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>We would not have you ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the troubles which happen'd unto us
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:66474:108"/>in Aſia, how that we were preſſed out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, above ſtrength, inſomuch that we deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ever of life, but we had the ſentence of death in our ſelves, that we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but in God that raiſeth the dead, who deliver'd us from ſo great a death, and doth deliver, in whom we truſt that he will yet deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us. Mordecai</hi> is called <hi>Pethakia,</hi> becauſe ſaith the <hi>Jews,</hi> he opened and expounded all matters; and underſtood 70 Languages. Experience may be called <hi>Pethakiah,</hi> it doth ſo interpret all Ridles, and dark matters both of the word and works of God, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains and interprets 70 and 70 Languages, if there be ſo many worth the interpreting; it makes a Man with eaſe and triumph to look thorow and over all before it, though never ſo dark and difficult, as <hi>David</hi> over <hi>Goliah,</hi> and <hi>Zerubabel</hi> over that great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which was before him, and <hi>Joſhuah</hi> the High Prieſt over ſin and Satans occaſions,—<hi>Is not this a brand pluckt out of the Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> By Prayer doth a believer come to this good eye-ſight, to look thorow all dark and difficult matters. <hi>When I cry to thee then ſhall mine enemies turn back, this I know, for God is for me, Pſal.</hi> 56.9. <hi>David</hi> had cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God, as one once did a little before an engagement, and he knew he ſhould have the day, and that his enemies would turn their backs; great clearing of fight is made by prayer and tears in dark days, to ſee tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:66474:108"/>matters. A little wind overthrows not only Houſes, but States and Kingdoms, ſaith <hi>Seneca.</hi> A little of this wind, I mean the pantings and prayings of God's People to Heaven, overthrows Perſons and Nations indeed, and is a ſure prognoſtick of good, to whom a praying ſpirit is given, and makes in the heart an aſſurance of good coming. <hi>My ſoul followeth hard after thee, thy right hand upholdeth me,</hi> (then obſerve what he ſaw) <hi>Thoſe that ſeek my ſoul to deſtroy it, ſhall go into the lower parts of the Earth, Pſal.</hi> 63.8, 9. Whether that were Hell, or the Grave, or both, 'twas well the Church and <hi>David</hi> were rid of them. Prayer is an Ordinance, by which the Soul goeth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and then gets a new life and ſtrength before it comes down again. Chriſt found the bleſſing of this Ordinance oft, and hath ſurely ſanctified it to all his for the ſame end, to lift up their heads and hearts above all troubles. <hi>He ſhall cry unto me thou art my Father, my God, the Rock of my Salvation, and I will make him my firſt born, higher than the Kings of the Earth, Pſal.</hi> 89.26. The whole courſe of Nature began with the motion of the Heavens, and continues ſtill vigorous, according to the continued moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them. Now as the motion of the Heavens is to the whole courſe of Nature, ſo is Prayer to all the graces of the Soul, and to the whole courſe and ſtate of the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:66474:109"/>new World; it is this that ſets all graces a going, and going true and ſtrong, let wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be what it will. Hence are thoſe perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent words of <hi>David. Truſt in the Lord at all times; ye People pour out your hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, God is a refuge for us, Selah, Pſal.</hi> 62.8. He maketh theſe ſubſervient one to another, faith to prayer, and prayer to faith, as indeed they are. Would you truſt in the Lord at all times, then pour out your ſouls to God: Would you pour out your ſouls to God, and pray alway, then truſt in the Lord at all times. Hence it is that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> when he had ſpoken at a great height of faith. <hi>Who hath delivered and doth deliver, in whom we truſt that he will yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver, &amp;c. You alſo helping together for us by Prayer,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11. Prayer mounts faith upon its high places, and faith mounts pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and makes one <hi>pray in his praying.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief is ſoul-fainting, and prayer is a fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freſh life from the Fountain of Life. Have mercy upon me, <hi>O Lord conſider my troubles, which I ſuffer of them that hate me, thou that lifteſt me up from the gates of death. Pſal.</hi> 13. that is, Soul and Body.</p>

'Tis true, the iſſues of War are doubtful, and <hi>Caſus fortuitus non eſt ſperan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> a doubtful caſe is not to be hoped; this may be good talk in humane matters, as we have to do in common bargening, but
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:66474:110"/>in divine matters as are to be confidered in order to God, it is not good ſo to reaſon; yet thus and no otherwiſe in all fortuitous and hazardous matters, will Men which have but meer reaſon; they will ſay there is no hope, and ſo fall to the uſe of their wits, and make haſt to ſome evil or other, if God do not mightily prevent. Though the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe be exceeding great and precious, and though there be many of them, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, yet a Man in whom is no faith, can ſee by theſe no relief at hand, but ſtill <hi>a dreadful ſound is in his ear, he believeth not that he ſhall return out of darkneſs, Job</hi> 15.21, 22. This ſtop of trade will beggar me; theſe croſſes and loſſes will certainly undo me; theſe and theſe Bags will be quite emptied by and by, and then what ſhall I do for more? And ſo inſtead of hoping to the end, the diſtreſſed Man never hopes at all, but univerſally down, and thus at every ſtraw and ſtrait. There was a univerſal darkneſs over the World for twelve hours, then was light created in this upper hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, ſaith a great Scholar: but where faith is not, there is a univerſal darkneſs for more than twelve hours, even all the days of the Man's life, and nothing can create light, neither the word nor works of God, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways and in all caſes the Man cries out, like that <hi>Rockwood</hi> (which was a great ſtirrer up of Perſecution againſt the Martyrs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

There are two things that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable duties as long as we live, and that is to wait on the Lord, and to keep his way, to which the bleſſing is certainly fixed, and no difficulty ſhall make it void. <hi>The wicked watcheth the righteous, and ſeeketh to ſlay him, the Lord will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.</hi> What is the uſe to be made of this? read the next words. <hi>Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he ſhall exalt thee to inherit the Land, when the wicked are cut off thou ſhalt ſee it, Pſal.</hi> 37.32, 33, 34. There are two parts in Religion, faith and obedience; that we walk in all Gods ways, and yet not reſt in this, but in Chriſt by faith; and this we ought in all weathers to do, and the good event of theſe, is certain. — <hi>God will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:66474:117"/>us to inherit the Land flowing with Milk and Hony. (i.e.)</hi> All good, God will give us a lift to the poſſeſſion of all that he hath promiſed. And therefore it is to deſtroy all Religion, and the recompence of reward too, to give way to unbelief. They that do not wait on the Lord, will ſurely not keep his way, and they that do not keep his way will not be exalted to inherit the good Land. Heatheniſme began at <hi>Babel;</hi> when the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue was loſt, at the confuſion of Tongues only to one Family was God and Salvation preached. And when this was loſt, Religion was loſt with it, and all the Earth became ſtrangers to God, and ſo lay 2203 Years, till the gift of Tongues at <hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> began to be given, to preach the Goſpel in every Language we may in this Glaſs ſee our black face at this day.) So I may ſay, that all tranſgreſſion even unto Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme, begins at unbelief; What will not an unbeliever be drawn unto? and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all miſery begins here too; and neither the one nor the other begin to be removed, till God begin to work faith in the Soul. And therefore I ſay again, and ſay ſome thing more than I did, you cannot give way to unbelief, and be innocent, you cannot give way to unbelief, but you give way to all ſin, and unto all miſery, See <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.23. <hi>And they ſhall be graffed in again, if they abide not ſtill in unbelief.</hi>

God promiſed (after the Flood was over) that Day and Night ſhould no more ceaſe; <hi>Gen.</hi> 8 22. which intimateth, ſaith one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that place, that during the Forty Days Rain which made the Flood, that the Day was as it were ceaſed and turned into Night by the great and thick Clouds, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts which were all over the World (and

Our Day through many Clouds and Storms is very dark, eſpecially to ſome; and yet the Day may more ceaſe, and become univerſally dark, that what it is to any one at this Hour for calamity, that it may be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally in one ſenſe or another. And when things are thus univerſally dark, that every ones day is ceaſed, it will look like a Doomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day indeed; and if you cannot look tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Clouds of your condition now, How will ye do then?

                  <hi>For I know your manifold tranſgreſſions, and your mighty ſins, they afflict the juſt, they take bribes, they turn aſide the poor in the Gate from their right, therefore the prudent ſhall keep ſilence, for it is an evil time, hate the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and love the good, eſtabliſh judgment in the Gate, it may be the Lord God of Hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Joſeph.

The other Scripture to ſet out the ſtate of the Chriſtian World at this day, is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.6 7. <hi>And he opened his mouth in blaſphemy againſt God, to blaſpheme his Name and his Tabernacle, and them which dwell in Heaven, and it was given unto him to make War with the Saints, and to overcome them, and power was given him over all Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, and Tongues, and Nations, and all ſhall worſhip him whoſe Names are not written in the Book of Life.</hi> The Anti-Chriſtian world is at theſe heights of ſin, blaſpheming the matters and People of God, and at Warre with them, ſhedding their blood, and their ſucceſs it ſeems will be general, power will be given them over all Kindreds, Tongues and Nations; and then when there is no Nation to flee to under Heaven, when the Earth, and the Sea, and the dry Land <hi>(i e.)</hi> all places and corners of the World ſhall be ſhaken, what need will there be of faith to flee to God. <hi>In the Generations, when the Son of David cometh</hi> (ſay the <hi>Jewes</hi>) <hi>the Scholars of the wiſe ſhall be rare, and as for the reſt of the People their eyes ſhall fail for ſorrow, and grief, and great afflictions, and

And the People reſted

How wonderful uſeful was <hi>Hezekiah</hi> by his faith, to the whole Nation in that ſtrait! He put a freſh life and ſoul into them: had he ſunk, they had all ſunk with him, and ſo the enemy and the wrath of God had juſtly preyed upon them all. The <hi>Arabians,</hi> if their King be ſick, all fain themſelves ſick too, as <hi>Homines ad Jervitatem parati,</hi> ſaith the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian.

And truly ones uſe loſt, is more than the loſs of ones life. What a dead living Man is a uſeleſs Man! and yet ſo ſhall we be, unleſs we get the faith of this Scripture I am upon in ſome meaſure, and the faith of this evil time wherein we live.

That which is the reaſon of God's doing a thing, may be the reaſon of our faith and hope, that it ſhall be done. Now the very notorious wickedneſs of the wicked, is the reaſon why he cuts them off, and puts others in their place, and therefore from the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs

And they ſpake againſt the God of Jeruſalem, as againſt the Gods of the People of the Earth, which were the work of the hands of Men. For this cauſe Hezekia the King, and the Prophet Iſaiah prayed and cryed to Heaven, and the Lord ſent an Angel and cut them off</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 32.19.20. 'Tis good Hiſtory to compare with this, 1 <hi>Maccabes</hi> 7.41. <hi>Nicanor</hi> carryed himſelf againſt the Lord and his People, as <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib,</hi> and abuſed the Prieſts of the Lord, and laughed at all their worſhip, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that if they did not deliver <hi>Judas Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabeus</hi> into his hands, and all his Hoſt, he would deſtroy the Temple, and Prieſts and all the People.
